// Content localization for Japanese *knowledge data* (principles, derived
// coaching items, source notes, tags). The chrome dictionary lives in i18n.tsx;
// this file translates the real business knowledge the platform teaches.
//
// Rule of thumb:
//   - Teachable knowledge (principles, derived items, tags, corpus notes) IS
//     translated here so an English audience gets a 100%-English screen.
//   - Verbatim interview quotes (Principle.support, corroborating_surveys) are
//     SOURCE MATERIAL and intentionally stay Japanese — translating a citation
//     would defeat its purpose as evidence. Those carry their own context.
//
// Fallback contract: if an English translation is missing, callers fall back to
// the Japanese original and surface a small "JP Original" badge so the screen is
// honest about what the reader is seeing.

    "Before setting up a technical meeting, propose ways to reduce the migration workload to the decision-maker, heading off the technical team's workload concerns in advance.",
  P008:
    "On a first visit, prioritize building the relationship over gathering information. Asking about systems or specs up front rarely draws answers, so start by listening to the customer's work and concerns.",

    "The customer is the one who ultimately chooses the vendor. Confirm their selection criteria first, then show your value in a way that fits those criteria.",
  P011:
    "Judge a request for the decision-maker to attend by timing and relationship. Asking abruptly before trust is built makes the contact feel sidelined and backfires. If the relationship is strong, ask early; if not, move step by step.",
