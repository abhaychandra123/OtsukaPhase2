# Senpai — Sales Knowledge & Onboarding Copilot (Otsuka, Phase 2)

Senpai makes the knowledge that lives in Otsuka's best salespeople available to every rep —
on demand and in context — while giving managers one place to read deal health and catch
dying deals early. It is a **fine-tuned, tool-calling assistant (exp3)** anchored to Otsuka's
real SPR data, not a generic sales chatbot.

The pitch in one line: **onboarding is the relatable face; pipeline reliability — "nobody
knows if a deal is real" — is the engine underneath.** The same deterministic deal-health
read that briefs a junior before a call also flags a manager's dying deal.

## Quickstart (web app)

Run the **backend** and **frontend** in two separate terminals. `SENPAI_USE_LLM=1` switches
live Coach commentary ON (default off = deterministic only).

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# install deps (Python bridge + frontend)
.\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
cd web; npm install; cd ..
```

# Terminal 1 — Backend bridge (FastAPI) → http://localhost:8000
$env:SENPAI_USE_LLM = '1'
$env:SENPAI_TODAY   = '2026-06-26'        # pin scoring's "today" to the seed anchor
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn senpai.api.server:app --port 8000 --host 127.0.0.1

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (Next.js) → http://localhost:3000   (defaults to the :8000 backend)
cd web; npm run dev
```

### Linux / macOS (bash)

```bash
# install deps (Python bridge + frontend)
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
( cd web && npm install )

# Terminal 1 — Backend bridge (FastAPI) → http://localhost:8000
export SENPAI_USE_LLM=1
export SENPAI_TODAY=2026-06-16            # pin scoring's "today" to the seed anchor
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn senpai.api.server:app --port 8000 --host 127.0.0.1

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (Next.js) → http://localhost:3000   (defaults to the :8000 backend)
cd web && npm run dev
```

The deal-health engine and unit tests are **pure Python (no GPU)**. Live Senior Commentary
additionally needs a GPU-served model on `:8765` — see **[Web app: switching on live Coach
commentary](#web-app-frontend--backend--switching-on-live-coach-commentary)** below for the
model server, the `SENPAI_USE_LLM` switch, and the `.env` wiring.

## Web app (frontend + backend) — switching on live Coach commentary

The Next.js web app (`web/`) talks to the FastAPI bridge (`senpai/api/server.py`), which in
turn streams the optional **Senior Commentary** from a GPU-served, OpenAI-compatible model
(llama.cpp `llama-server`). The deterministic Review Coach always works without a model; the
LLM only *rephrases* the same findings. Live commentary is **gated OFF by default** — you turn
it on with one backend env var.

> The web↔engine boundary, the "endpoint first, then types/api/fixture" rule, and the drift
> check (`scripts/check_contract.py`) are documented in [`docs/web-integration.md`](docs/web-integration.md).

Start three things, in order:

### 1. Model server (GPU box) — `:8765`

The model is served by `llama-server` on the GPU box and reached over an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint. The bridge reads the endpoint + model name from the **repo-root `.env`** (loaded
automatically by `senpai/config.py`):

```bash
# E:\my_stuff\OtsukaPhase2\.env
BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1"                          # via SSH tunnel (see below)
MODEL="Qwen3.6-27B-Claude-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled"          # llama-server ignores this field; label only
```

**Connectivity (from this Windows box):** the direct Tailscale URL
`http://100.101.186.29:8765/v1` is **firewalled** — the host pings but the port refuses. Reach
the server through an SSH tunnel instead, then point `BASE_URL` at `127.0.0.1:8765` (as above):

```bash
ssh -N -L 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 team-a@100.101.186.29     # leave running in its own terminal
```

**Starting / restarting the model** (the 27B GGUF is periodically **OOM-killed** on the shared
GB10 — when the Assistant shows "Couldn't reach the server", relaunch it):

```bash
# from anywhere — launches detached on the GPU box
ssh team-a@100.101.186.29 'cd ~/Desktop/toolcallLM/qwen3 && \
  setsid bash -c "./serve_gguf.sh > llama-server.log 2>&1" </dev/null &'
```

Sanity check it's up (needs the tunnel): `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/models`.
Check it's alive on the box: `ssh team-a@100.101.186.29 'pgrep -af llama-server'`.
> A `couldn't bind … 0.0.0.0:8765` line in the llama-server log just means a **second** launch
> hit an already-running instance — the first one is fine.

### 2. Backend bridge (FastAPI) — `:8000`  ← **this is the switch**

```bash
# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:SENPAI_USE_LLM = '1'        # ← switches live commentary ON (default '0' = deterministic only)
$env:SENPAI_TODAY   = '2026-06-23'   # pin scoring's "today" to the seed anchor
python -m uvicorn senpai.api.server:app --port 8000 --host 127.0.0.1
```

```bash
# bash / macOS / Linux
export SENPAI_USE_LLM=1
export SENPAI_TODAY=2026-06-16
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn senpai.api.server:app --port 8000 --host 127.0.0.1
```

- **`SENPAI_USE_LLM=1` is the on/off switch.** Without it, `/api/coach/narrate` returns
  `unavailable: llm_disabled` and the UI shows *"Couldn't reach the explanation model…"*.
- The bridge has **no `--reload`**: after editing `.env` (or any Python), **restart it** to pick
  up the change.
- Verify: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health` → `{"status":"ok", …}`.

### 3. Frontend (Next.js) — `:3000`

```bash
cd web
npm install            # first time only
npm run dev            # → http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend points at the backend via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, which **defaults to
`http://localhost:8000`** — so if the bridge runs on :8000 you need no config. To target a
different host, create `web/.env.local`:

```bash
# web/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="http://localhost:8000"
```

Then open **Review Coach → Get the senior's read**: with the backend switch on and the model
reachable, the commentary streams in live. With either off, the page falls back cleanly to the
deterministic coaching.

### Senior Commentary — what it does, and its contract

The commentary is an **experienced rep's interpretation** layered on the deterministic coach —
not a restatement of the six lenses. Before calling the model, the bridge builds a grounded
**context package** (`senpai/coach/context.py`): it resolves the customer named in the note to a
real deal, then assembles that deal's health, recent activity, quote/order history, prior
deals, and a similar past case. The model reasons over that context and answers in four short
sections (Situation Summary / What an Experienced Rep Would Focus On / Likely Customer Dynamics
/ Practical Advice).

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Active model** | `Qwen3.6-27B-Claude-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled` (GGUF Q4_K_M, llama-server) — shown in the UI's `start`/`Generated by` badge |
| **Endpoint** | pinned to `BASE_URL` from `.env` (`http://100.101.186.29:8765/v1`). The request sets `allow_fallback=False` — it **never** silently switches to another model. |
| **Latency** | Reasoning is **disabled** (empty-`<think>` prefill) and output is capped at `LLM_NARRATE_MAX_TOKENS` (default 260) → ~15–22s, vs ~60–90s with reasoning on. |
| **Fallback behaviour** | If the endpoint is down/empty, the stream emits `unavailable` and the UI shows **"Senior commentary unavailable — the deterministic coaching above still stands."** No second model is used. |
| **Grounding** | Only real store records are used. If the note names no known customer, the UI shows no "Grounded in …" badge and the model is told to read from the note alone and invent nothing. |

Tunables (env): `LLM_NARRATE_MAX_TOKENS` (length/latency trade-off), `LLM_TIMEOUT` (per-read
stream timeout). The model name is a label only — llama-server serves whatever GGUF is loaded.

## What's inside the pipeline (at a glance)

- **Real SPR schema.** `senpai/data/gen_seed.py` generates byte-stable synthetic data in
  Otsuka's production shape (`deals`, `orders`, `quotes`, `sales_activities`), so the real
  data is a drop-in when we get access. `order_rank` (`1_Confirmed … 8_Cancelled`) is the spine.
- **Deterministic deal-health engine.** Seven rank-aware signals (staleness, rank stagnation,
  order-date passed, rank regression, missing decision-maker, stall language, low activity) →
  a 🔴🟡🟢 score with a Japanese reason for every signal. No number is ever invented by a model.
- **Report-reliability flags.** Surfaces deals whose recorded rank contradicts their activity
  signals (`optimism_mismatch`, `stale_active`, `close_date_passed`, …).
- **Web app over one shared engine.** A Next.js frontend (Review Coach, Knowledge Explorer,
  manager workspace, growth) on a FastAPI bridge — junior briefs/playbook/report drafting and
  manager at-risk deals, report digests, and coaching focus, all reading the same deterministic
  engine, with optional GPU-served Senior Commentary.

## Verify (no GPU)
