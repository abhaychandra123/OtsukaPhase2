"""Crew gather capability.

The crew agents' prompts consume the STRING outputs of the existing deterministic
tools (query_spr, find_similar_deals, search_notes, …). To preserve those artifacts
byte-for-byte while running the gather on the orchestration engine, we expose one
thin capability that runs any existing tool by name through `impl.dispatch` — the
single shared tool layer. No retrieval logic is reimplemented or duplicated; this is
purely the engine's adapter onto the tools the crew already used.

(M1's research capabilities emit *structured* evidence for the research summarizer;
the crew prompts were written against *tool strings*, so they share the engine and
the underlying `store`/`impl` layer rather than the M1 capability classes. Capability
convergence is the post-migration simplification step, not M2.)
