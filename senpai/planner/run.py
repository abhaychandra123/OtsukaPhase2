"""Run a document goal end-to-end through the planner spine:

    goal ──► LLMPlanner ──► ExecutionPlan ──► ExecutionEngine ──► EvidenceBundle ──► artifact

`run_document_goal` is the one entry point. It plans, publishes the conversation so
the Conversation/Documents capabilities can see it, executes the plan on the shared
ExecutionEngine, and reads the terminal `documents` fragment out of the bundle as
the artifact. Gather failures degrade to empty (the engine never crashes a run), so
a down web search or an empty workspace just means less grounding — never no deck.

For document generation the "Reasoner" step is trivial — the artifact IS the file,
and the Documents capability already produced the one-line confirmation. The Reasoner
seam (senpai/orchestration/reason.py) is where meeting-prep / account-intelligence
will synthesize prose over the bundle in the next milestone.

`python -m senpai.planner.run "D001 の提案書を作って"` runs it (proposal path is GPU-free).
