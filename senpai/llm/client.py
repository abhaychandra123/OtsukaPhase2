"""OpenAI client + tool-calling loop for exp3 — ported from demo/app.py.

Keeps the demo's proven behaviour: native OpenAI `tool_calls` with a safe
`_parse_xlam` fallback for the XLAM-style text the model sometimes emits. The
tool loop is factored into `stream_turn` (used by the Gradio chat) and a thin
`simple_complete` (used by narration). Network/parse failures are surfaced as
strings or raised for the caller to fall back on — nothing here crashes the app.
