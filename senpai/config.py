"""Central configuration for Senpai.

Holds the model-server connection details (shared with the Phase-1 demo), the
filesystem paths to the seed data, and — most importantly — the *tunable* deal-
health scoring parameters. Everything the scoring engine treats as a threshold
lives here so the rules stay auditable and adjustable in one place (no magic
numbers buried in the engine).

Env:
  BASE_URL      default http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1   (vLLM OpenAI endpoint)
  MODEL         default exp3
  SENPAI_TODAY  default unset → date.today(); set YYYY-MM-DD to pin the
                "current date" used by scoring (handy for a reproducible demo
                against the committed seed data, whose reference is 2026-06-16).
