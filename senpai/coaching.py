"""Manager coaching workspace — Pillar: Coaching / Visibility.

A read-only aggregation over the SAME deterministic engines the dashboard uses
(`score_deal`, `deal_flags`). It answers a manager's daily question — "where
should I spend my coaching time today?" — with four grounded views:

  1. needs_coaching  — a ranked queue of deals with the single coaching issue
                       that matters most for each, and a transparent reason.
  2. trends          — the most common coaching themes across the team, with a
                       direction derived from real rank movement.
  3. confidence      — Confidence vs Reality: the rep's expressed confidence (the
                       order_rank itself) checked against observed signals.
  4. summary         — a simple weekly digest.

No new scores, no prediction, no LLM. Every issue maps to a rule a manager can
read off the data. Reason text is returned as a key + params so the frontend can
render it natively in either language.
