# Orchestration architecture

The reusable spine that turns Senpai's per-route gather/synthesis logic into one
layer: a **planner** produces a DAG of deterministic **capabilities**, an
**execution engine** runs them in parallel and collects their structured output
into an immutable **evidence bundle**, and a single **reasoner** synthesizes the
artifact. New capabilities (Filesystem, Email, Calendar, Browser, Office) become
*additive* — write one class, register it — instead of another rewrite.

> Status: **M0 + M1 + M2 + M3 shipped.** M0 = the engine (`senpai/orchestration/`).
> M1 = Research. M2 = crew + team gather. M3 = account gather (`senpai/account/`),
> plus a consolidation pass (dead code removed, shaping de-duplicated). All
> retrieval-heavy workflows now share the spine, all parity-proven and live. What
> remains is the deferred simplification phase. See "Migration" below.

## The pipeline

```
plan ──► ExecutionEngine ──► EvidenceBundle ──► [Reducer] ──► [Reasoner] ──► [Approval Gate] ──► artifact
          (capabilities)                          stub          seam            future
```

Two stages beyond the naive line exist because of the long-horizon target query
(*"prepare me for tomorrow's Endo Kogyo meeting — gather every proposal, quote,
note, PPTX, PDF, calendar event, email, playbook, then summarize and draft a
follow-up"*):

- **Reducer** — gathering "every document" overflows any single reasoner context.
  A map-reduce compaction step sits between bundle and reasoner. M0 ships a
  pass-through; a real `MapReduceReducer` lands when a capability can produce
  bundle-overflowing volume.
- **Approval Gate** — "draft a follow-up" is *effectful*. WRITE tasks pause the DAG
  for human approval. Today's two-step `confirm=` in `generate_*` is a hand-rolled
  instance; the gate generalizes it. Deferred until the first WRITE capability.

---

## Why this shape

Three of Senpai's five orchestration surfaces are *already* plan→gather→bundle→reason,
just hardcoded and inconsistent:

| Target concept | Already exists as | Location |
|---|---|---|
| EvidenceBundle | `ResearchBundle` (has provenance) | `api/server.py` |
| Capability executors | tool fns + `store` + `score_deal` | `tools/impl.py`, `data/store.py` |
| Parallel engine | `_worker` + `queue.Queue` + threads | `agent/crew.py` |
| Single reasoner | 4 copies of "one LLM over context" | research / crew / account / team |
| Target resolution | `resolve_crew_target`, `resolve_customer_detailed` | `crew.py`, `store.py` |

The one genuinely LLM-*planned* surface is `/api/chat`'s `stream_chat_turn` (the
model picks tools dynamically). **Scope: unify the four deterministic surfaces
(research, crew, account, team); leave the chat tool-loop alone.** It may later
share the same capabilities, but its dynamic planning stays.

---

## Design decisions

### Planner — a dynamic DAG
Not a flat list (can't express "web only if CRM misses" or "reason after all"),
not fixed execution levels (a barrier between levels stalls independent work). A
**DAG**: tasks declare `depends_on`; the engine computes readiness continuously.
Crucially the DAG **expands at runtime** — `Filesystem.find_documents` returns N
refs → the engine appends N `Office.extract` tasks. The breadth of a real prep
query is unknowable at plan time.

The planner stays *non-reasoning*: seed plans are deterministic; runtime expansion
is data-driven (not an LLM). A `Planner` Protocol seam lets a future `LLMPlanner`
choose capabilities for open-ended requests without touching the engine. **M0/M1
build plans as plain functions** — no Planner object yet.

### Task — 4 core fields, policy defaulted
```python
Task(id, capability, op="", inputs={}, depends_on=frozenset(),
     policy=DEFAULT_POLICY, group="default", summary="")
```
- `inputs` are literals; a task reads upstream outputs from `ctx.deps` — **no Ref
  DSL** (added later only if ergonomics demand).
- `TaskPolicy(timeout_s, retries, on_failure)` — one small struct, capability-level
  defaults. WRITE safety = the plan sets `retries=0`; no `OperationKind` enum yet.
- A Task carries **no result** — outcomes live in the bundle, keyed by `task.id`.
  Plan and result stay separate, which is what keeps both immutable.

### Capability — one domain, stable interface
```python
class Capability(Protocol):
    name: str
    def run(self, op, inputs, ctx) -> Evidence: ...
```
A capability owns a domain (CRM has `lookup_deal`/`list_proposals`; `run` dispatches
on `op`). It does deterministic work, returns structured `Evidence`, and **never
reasons, orchestrates, or calls another capability**. Its only window outward is
`ExecContext`:

```python
ExecContext(task_id, inputs, deps, emit, expand, cancel, deadline)
#   deps     upstream evidence by task id
#   emit     report a sub-step  -> task.progress event
#   expand   request new tasks  (runtime fan-out)
#   cancel   cooperative cancellation token
```
New cross-cutting concerns (auth/connections, tracing) are added as `ExecContext`
fields later — no capability signature changes.

### EvidenceBundle — immutable, append-only, no reconciliation
Each task writes exactly one `Evidence` fragment keyed by its id; fragments never
overwrite each other → no locks, order-independent. Two sources disagreeing is
**signal for the reasoner**, not something the engine resolves — provenance is
always preserved.

```python
Evidence(status, data, citations, confidence, provenance,
         task_id, capability, op, group, timing)   # last 5 stamped by the engine
```
- `data` is structured JSON, never markdown. `citations` are human handles
  ("SPR D003", "Playbook PB12", "file://…#slide3") the artifact can quote.
- `provenance` (machine locus, for audit/Retrieval-Explorer) is kept distinct from
  `citations` (renderable). `to_reasoner_view()` is the canonical, error-dropped,
  deterministically-ordered view the Reducer/Reasoner consume.

### Execution engine — one threaded scheduler loop
`ExecutionEngine.run(plan, emit) -> EvidenceBundle`. ThreadPoolExecutor, not
asyncio (the OpenAI client and store are blocking; threads parallelize them with no
stack rewrite; `crew.py` already proves the model). The loop:

1. absorb any tasks a running capability asked to add (`ctx.expand`)
2. submit every PENDING task whose dependencies are all terminal
3. wait for the next task; record evidence, emit events
4. if a `fail_run` task failed → cancel and drain
   until nothing is pending and nothing is running.

Supports: dependency-aware scheduling, parallelism, retries (READ-safe ops),
cooperative cancellation, **partial failure** (default `on_failure="skip"` — one
bad capability degrades, never crashes the run), runtime expansion. A capability
raising is caught and turned into an error fragment.

---

## Event model — one vocabulary

The engine is the single source. Events describe the **DAG lifecycle**, never a
domain — adding Browser/Email needs zero new event types. Every event carries
`type, run_id, seq` (monotonic), `ts`.

```
run.started {groups, planned_count}      plan.expanded {added_count, total_count}
task.started {task_id, capability, op, group, summary}
task.progress {task_id, message}         task.evidence {task_id, status, confidence, citations}
task.completed {task_id, duration, status}
task.retrying / task.failed              group.completed {group}
run.completed {completed, failed} / run.cancelled
# reserved (route/Reducer/Reasoner, not engine): reduce.* reason.* artifact.created
#                                                 approval.required auth.required
```

`group` + `summary` are the only layout drivers: a multi-lane `/crew` and a
single-stream `/research` are the **same event stream**, different grouping → the
front-end collapses to one `<ExecutionTimeline>` (Cursor / Deep-Research style).
During migration, thin per-route adapters translate these to the legacy SSE names
so the existing UI keeps working byte-for-byte.

---

## The Endo Kogyo walkthrough

1. **Resolve** "Endo Kogyo" → `customer_id` (existing resolver; ambiguity → picker).
2. **Seed plan** (deterministic `meeting_prep` template): parallel READ tasks —
   `CRM.list_deals/list_proposals/list_quotes`, `Activities.meeting_notes`,
   `Filesystem.find_documents`, `Calendar.find_events`, `Email.recent`,
   `Knowledge.relevant_playbooks`.
3. **Runtime expansion**: `find_documents` → N refs → `ctx.expand(Office.extract×N)`;
   `Email.recent` → threads → `Email.fetch_thread×M`. `plan.expanded` fires.
4. **Parallel gather** under per-capability concurrency caps + auth. `Email` token
   expired → `auth.required`; that branch degrades, the rest proceeds.
5. **EvidenceBundle** accumulates ~30 fragments with citations + confidence.
6. **Reducer** (30 docs overflow the reasoner) → per-document/group map summaries.
7. **Reasoner** (single) → prep summary + follow-up plan, citing sources.
8. **Approval Gate**: "draft follow-up" is WRITE → `approval.required` + preview →
   on approve, `Email.draft` / `Office.export_pptx` → `artifact.created`.

### Weaknesses this surfaces (and the answers)

| Weakness | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Context overflow on "every document" | **Reducer** map-reduce before synthesis |
| Per-user auth/secrets for external caps | `ConnectionProvider` field on `ExecContext`; `auth.required` event |
| Cost / rate limits (Browser, APIs) | per-capability concurrency caps + `priority` + timeouts + cancellation |
| Effectful safety/ordering (send, book) | `OperationKind=WRITE` + **Approval Gate**; no auto-retry/cache |
| Repeated work across sessions | content-addressed `cache` key in `TaskPolicy` |
| Open-ended intent phrasing | `Planner` seam → future `LLMPlanner`, same `ExecutionPlan` |
| Non-reproducibility of web/email/browser | provenance + timestamps make it *auditable*, not reproducible |

The first four mitigations are *seams reserved in M0* (event constants,
`ExecContext`/`TaskPolicy` shape), not yet implemented — so adding them is not a
rewrite.

---

## M0 — what shipped

`senpai/orchestration/`, GPU-free, no network, not wired to routes:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capability.py` | `Task`, `TaskPolicy`, `ExecutionPlan` (+cycle check), `Capability`, `ExecContext`, `CapabilityRegistry` |
| `evidence.py` | `Evidence` (`ok/empty/error`), `EvidenceBundle` (views, `to_reasoner_view`), `Timing` |
| `engine.py` | `ExecutionEngine` — the one scheduler loop |
| `events.py` | the unified event vocabulary (constants + shapes) |
| `reason.py` | `Reasoner` Protocol + `EchoReasoner` (no-LLM) + `LLMReasoner` (lazy) |
| `reducer.py` | `Reducer` Protocol + `PassthroughReducer` |
| `planner.py` | `Planner` Protocol seam |
| `__main__.py` | self-test |

**Self-test** (`python -m senpai.orchestration` → `RESULT: PASS`) proves: parallelism
(7 tasks 0.5s wall vs ~1.4s serial), dependency ordering, runtime fan-out, retries,
partial-failure degradation, ordered timeline, citations, error-dropping view.

### Simplifications taken (deferred, with a seam)
Planner classes, `Ref` input-binding DSL, `OperationKind` enum + Approval Gate, full
Reducer/Reasoner impls, plan-level reasoner/reducer specs, `priority`/`cache`/per-op
`defaults`, `ConnectionProvider`/`auth.required` — all dropped from M0, each kept as
a Protocol stub or a reserved field/constant so it is additive.

---

## Migration (zero-regression first)

- **M0** ✅ scaffolding, isolated, unit-tested.
- **M1** ✅ Research over the engine — parity-proven, live (details below).
- **M2** ✅ Crew + team gather over the engine — multi-agent UX preserved (below).
- **M3** ✅ Consolidation + account gather over the engine — parity-proven (below).
- **Simplification phase** (deferred, post-migration) — converge the three reasoners
  onto `reason.py`, unify the SSE dialects onto `events.py`, then (a product
  decision) collapse the multi-agent flow into one Planner → Engine → Reasoner.
  `/api/chat`'s dynamic tool-loop stays until the `LLMPlanner` seam is built.

Capabilities call `store`/`scoring` directly (structured), not the string tools in
`impl.py` — those stay for the chat loop. `llm/client.py` is untouched; the Reasoner
wraps `stream_complete`.

---

## M1 — Research migrated (parity-proven)

The Research gather now runs on the engine; resolution, source emission, ambiguity,
web-fallback, and the reasoner are unchanged. **The frontend cannot tell.**

`senpai/research/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `shaping.py` | byte-for-byte replicas of the server's `_deal_summary` (split into `deal_facts` + `health_read`), `_activity_summary`, `_public_customer`, `_products_for_deals` |
| `capabilities.py` | `CRM`, `Activities`, `SimilarDeals`, `Health`, `Environment`, `Web` — thin wrappers over `store` / `score_deal` / `find_similar_deals` / `web_search_typed` |
| `plan.py` | `research_plan(mode=customer\|deal)` + `web_plan()` |
| `gather.py` | runs the engine, re-merges facts+health, rebuilds provenance per mode → the exact legacy field set |

**The DAG (proves dependency handling):** `crm`, `activities`, `similar_deals`,
`environment` run in parallel; **`health` depends on `crm` + `similar_deals`** (it
scores every deal id they surfaced). The gather re-merges
`{**deal_facts, "health": …}` into the identical legacy `_deal_summary` shape.

**Wiring:** `_build_research_bundle` / `_build_deal_context_bundle` get `*_orch`
twins that the live `/research` (and the chat research route) call; the legacy
builders are kept as the **parity oracle**, not deleted (per "remove only after
parity is confirmed").

**Parity strategy:** the LLM answer is non-deterministic, so we don't diff text — we
prove the *evidence bundle fed to the reasoner is identical*
(`orch.to_dict() == legacy.to_dict()`), which makes artifact quality identical by
construction. `tests/test_research_parity.py` (84 cases): 40 customers × valid-
customer bundle, 40 deal-context bundles, citations present, not-found shell,
web-fallback pass-through, and **partial-failure degradation** (a capability raising
→ that source becomes empty/`not_found`, the run still completes — where the legacy
inline code would have crashed). Full suite: **219 passed, 0 regressions** (the one
remaining `test_research.py` failure is pre-existing and unrelated — verified
identical with M1 changes stashed).

**One deviation:** the not-found **web fallback stays on the direct `web_search_typed`
seam**, not routed through the engine. It is a single external call (not gather
orchestration) and existing tests patch that symbol; routing it through a 1-task plan
added no value and moved a test seam. `WebCapability` is still built and exercised by
the golden test via `web_search_via_engine`.

---

## M2 — Crew gather migrated (multi-agent UX preserved)

`/crew` (and the `/team` fan-out) keep their exact UX — Researcher + Coach run in
parallel, then the Strategist synthesizes a Strategy Brief — but each agent's data
gathering now runs on the engine. Prompts, artifacts, streaming events, and
provenance are unchanged.

**Why not the M1 capabilities directly?** The crew prompts were written against the
*string* outputs of the deterministic tools (`query_spr`, `find_similar_deals`,
`search_notes`, …); M1's capabilities emit *structured* evidence for the research
summarizer. Feeding the crew M1's structured bundle would change its grounding and
therefore its artifact. So M2 shares the **engine and the same underlying tool
layer**, via one tiny capability rather than the M1 capability classes:

`senpai/agent/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capabilities.py` | `ToolCapability` — runs any existing tool through `impl.dispatch(op, inputs)`. One wrapper over the shared tool layer; **zero retrieval logic duplicated** (no CRM/Activities/Health/Environment/SimilarDeals/Web reimplemented). |
| `plan.py` | `researcher_plan` (4 tools) / `coach_plan` (1) / `rep_analyst_plan` (2) — same tools, args, order, and human summaries as before. |
| `gather.py` | `run_agent_gather(plan, agent_id, emit)` — runs the plan, translates each `task.started` into the legacy `agent_tool` event (same name/summary/order), returns the tool strings for the agent to assemble its grounding. |

`crew.py`'s `_run_researcher` / `_run_coach` / `_run_rep_analyst` lost their inline
tool calls and now call `run_agent_gather`; everything else (the parallel `_worker`
threads, the prompts, `_run_strategist`, the `crew`/`agent`/`final`/`done` events) is
untouched. Net effect: each agent's tools now run **in parallel** instead of
sequentially (a latency win), with the grounding reassembled in the prompt's fixed
order so the artifact is identical.

**Parity** (`tests/test_crew_parity.py`, 63 cases): per-deal researcher grounding ==
legacy tool strings (30 deals), coach grounding == legacy (30), rep-analyst gather ==
legacy, partial-failure degradation (a tool raising → empty slot, gather completes),
and an **end-to-end `run_crew` event-sequence test** (LLM stubbed) asserting the full
`crew → agents+agent_tool → strategist → final → done` timeline is preserved. Full
suite: **282 passed, 0 new regressions** (same single pre-existing `test_research.py`
failure, unrelated).

After M2, every retrieval-heavy workflow (research, crew, team) shares the engine.
The remaining per-agent reasoning (Researcher/Coach/Strategist prose) is intentionally
kept — collapsing it into a single Reasoner is the post-migration simplification, not
part of M2.

---

## M3 — Consolidation + account migrated

Three steps, recommended order, parity-first:

**1. Dead code removed.** `_legacy_research_stream` (server.py) — an unused duplicate
of the live `research_stream` and the only remaining caller of the legacy
`_build_research_bundle` — deleted. The legacy bundle builders stay (now used only by
the M1 parity oracle).

**2. Shaping de-duplicated.** `_deal_summary` / `_public_customer` / `_activity_summary`
/ `_products_for_deals` existed byte-identically in both `server.py` and
`research/shaping.py`. `research/shaping.py` is now canonical; the server functions
are thin aliases that delegate to it (preserving every call site and the implicit
`_today()` default). The M1/M2 parity suites (147 cases) confirm no behavioral change.

**3. Account gather on the engine** (`senpai/account/`):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capabilities.py` | `AccountContextCapability` — wraps `build_account_context` as structured evidence (same call, same `(context_text, meta)`) |
| `plan.py` | `account_plan()` — a single gather task |
| `gather.py` | `gather_account_context()` — runs the plan on the engine; degrades to the package's own not-found shape on failure |

`account_commentary` now calls `gather_account_context` instead of
`build_account_context`. The commentary artifact is driven entirely by
`account_commentary_prompt(context_text)`, so identical `(context_text, meta)` ⇒
identical prompt ⇒ identical artifact. The route's events (`start` / `artifact_meta`
/ `context` / `strategy` / `delta` / `done`), the prompt, and the inline reasoner
stream are untouched.

The account context is one composite text+meta unit, so it is wrapped as a **single**
capability (like M1's web fallback). Decomposing it into the shared
CRM/Health/Environment capabilities — and converging the account prompt onto
structured evidence — belongs to the simplification phase, not M3.

**Parity** (`tests/test_account_parity.py`, 123 cases): 60 accounts × {ja, en} assert
`gather_account_context == build_account_context`, plus not-found parity and
degraded-failure resilience. Full suite: **405 passed, 0 new regressions** (same lone
pre-existing `test_research.py` failure).

---

## Migration complete — state of the spine

Every retrieval-heavy workflow now gathers through the engine:

| Workflow | Gather | Reasoner (still bespoke) | Events |
|---|---|---|---|
| research | engine (6 caps, DAG) | `_summarize_research_bundle` | source/answer |
| crew | engine (`ToolCapability`) | per-agent `simple_complete` + strategist | agent/agent_tool |
| team | engine (`ToolCapability`) | team-lead `simple_complete` | agent/agent_tool |
| account | engine (1 cap) | inline `stream_complete` | context/delta |
| `/api/chat` | LLM-planned tool loop (intentionally not migrated) | routed synthesis | tool/delta |

The deferred simplification phase is now the only remaining work: (1) converge the
four reasoners onto `reason.py`; (2) unify the three SSE dialects onto the
`events.py` vocabulary once the frontend can consume it; (3) the product decision on
collapsing the multi-agent flow; (4) build the `LLMPlanner` seam to fold in
`/api/chat`. None of these are required for correctness — they are consolidation.
