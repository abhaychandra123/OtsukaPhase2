# Orchestration architecture

The reusable spine that turns Senpai's per-route gather/synthesis logic into one
layer: a **planner** produces a DAG of deterministic **capabilities**, an
**execution engine** runs them in parallel and collects their structured output
into an immutable **evidence bundle**, and a single **reasoner** synthesizes the
artifact. New capabilities (Filesystem, Email, Calendar, Browser, Office) become
*additive* — write one class, register it — instead of another rewrite.

> Status: **M0–M6 shipped.** M0 = the engine (`senpai/orchestration/`). M1 = Research.
> M2 = crew + team gather. M3 = account gather (`senpai/account/`) + a consolidation
> pass. M4 = the `/api/chat` tool loop on the engine via the **AdaptiveScheduler**. M5
> = the **Workspace capability** (`senpai/workspace/`) — sandboxed local documents, and
> the first production user of **runtime DAG expansion** (`ctx.expand`). M6 = the
> **`LLMPlanner`** (`senpai/planner/`) — goal → capability graph → engine → artifact,

## The pipeline

```
plan ──► ExecutionEngine ──► EvidenceBundle ──► [Reducer] ──► [Reasoner] ──► [Approval Gate] ──► artifact
          (capabilities)                          stub          seam            future
```

Two stages beyond the naive line exist because of the long-horizon target query
(*"prepare me for tomorrow's Endo Kogyo meeting — gather every proposal, quote,
note, PPTX, PDF, calendar event, email, playbook, then summarize and draft a
follow-up"*):

- **Reducer** — gathering "every document" overflows any single reasoner context.
  A map-reduce compaction step sits between bundle and reasoner. M0 ships a
  pass-through; a real `MapReduceReducer` lands when a capability can produce
  bundle-overflowing volume.
- **Approval Gate** — "draft a follow-up" is *effectful*. WRITE tasks pause the DAG
  for human approval. Today's two-step `confirm=` in `generate_*` is a hand-rolled
  instance; the gate generalizes it. Deferred until the first WRITE capability.

---

## Why this shape

Three of Senpai's five orchestration surfaces are *already* plan→gather→bundle→reason,
just hardcoded and inconsistent:

| Target concept | Already exists as | Location |
|---|---|---|
| EvidenceBundle | `ResearchBundle` (has provenance) | `api/server.py` |
| Capability executors | tool fns + `store` + `score_deal` | `tools/impl.py`, `data/store.py` |
| Parallel engine | `_worker` + `queue.Queue` + threads | `agent/crew.py` |
| Single reasoner | 4 copies of "one LLM over context" | research / crew / account / team |
| Target resolution | `resolve_crew_target`, `resolve_customer_detailed` | `crew.py`, `store.py` |

The one genuinely LLM-*planned* surface is `/api/chat`'s `stream_chat_turn` (the
model picks tools dynamically). The original scope was "unify the four deterministic
surfaces; leave the chat tool-loop alone." **M4 revised that:** the chat loop now runs
its tool calls *through the engine* via the AdaptiveScheduler (below), so it shares the
engine and parallelism — but its *planning* is still the LLM emitting tool calls, not a
`Planner`. The DAG-planning of open-ended goals is the `LLMPlanner`, still ahead.

---

## Design decisions

### Planner — a dynamic DAG
Not a flat list (can't express "web only if CRM misses" or "reason after all"),
not fixed execution levels (a barrier between levels stalls independent work). A
**DAG**: tasks declare `depends_on`; the engine computes readiness continuously.
Crucially the DAG **expands at runtime** — `Filesystem.find_documents` returns N
refs → the engine appends N `Office.extract` tasks. The breadth of a real prep
query is unknowable at plan time.

The planner stays *non-reasoning*: seed plans are deterministic; runtime expansion
is data-driven (not an LLM). A `Planner` Protocol seam lets a future `LLMPlanner`
choose capabilities for open-ended requests without touching the engine. **M0/M1
build plans as plain functions** — no Planner object yet.

### Task — 4 core fields, policy defaulted
```python
Task(id, capability, op="", inputs={}, depends_on=frozenset(),
     policy=DEFAULT_POLICY, group="default", summary="")
```
- `inputs` are literals; a task reads upstream outputs from `ctx.deps` — **no Ref
  DSL** (added later only if ergonomics demand).
- `TaskPolicy(timeout_s, retries, on_failure)` — one small struct, capability-level
  defaults. WRITE safety = the plan sets `retries=0`; no `OperationKind` enum yet.
- A Task carries **no result** — outcomes live in the bundle, keyed by `task.id`.
  Plan and result stay separate, which is what keeps both immutable.

### Capability — one domain, stable interface
```python
class Capability(Protocol):
    name: str
    def run(self, op, inputs, ctx) -> Evidence: ...
```
A capability owns a domain (CRM has `lookup_deal`/`list_proposals`; `run` dispatches
on `op`). It does deterministic work, returns structured `Evidence`, and **never
reasons, orchestrates, or calls another capability**. Its only window outward is
`ExecContext`:

```python
ExecContext(task_id, inputs, deps, emit, expand, cancel, deadline)
#   deps     upstream evidence by task id
#   emit     report a sub-step  -> task.progress event
#   expand   request new tasks  (runtime fan-out)
#   cancel   cooperative cancellation token
```
New cross-cutting concerns (auth/connections, tracing) are added as `ExecContext`
fields later — no capability signature changes.

### EvidenceBundle — immutable, append-only, no reconciliation
Each task writes exactly one `Evidence` fragment keyed by its id; fragments never
overwrite each other → no locks, order-independent. Two sources disagreeing is
**signal for the reasoner**, not something the engine resolves — provenance is
always preserved.

```python
Evidence(status, data, citations, confidence, provenance,
         task_id, capability, op, group, timing)   # last 5 stamped by the engine
```
- `data` is structured JSON, never markdown. `citations` are human handles
  ("SPR D003", "Playbook PB12", "file://…#slide3") the artifact can quote.
- `provenance` (machine locus, for audit/Retrieval-Explorer) is kept distinct from
  `citations` (renderable). `to_reasoner_view()` is the canonical, error-dropped,
  deterministically-ordered view the Reducer/Reasoner consume.

### Execution engine — one threaded scheduler loop
`ExecutionEngine.run(plan, emit) -> EvidenceBundle`. ThreadPoolExecutor, not
asyncio (the OpenAI client and store are blocking; threads parallelize them with no
stack rewrite; `crew.py` already proves the model). The loop:

1. absorb any tasks a running capability asked to add (`ctx.expand`)
2. submit every PENDING task whose dependencies are all terminal
3. wait for the next task; record evidence, emit events
4. if a `fail_run` task failed → cancel and drain
   until nothing is pending and nothing is running.

Supports: dependency-aware scheduling, parallelism, retries (READ-safe ops),
cooperative cancellation, **partial failure** (default `on_failure="skip"` — one
bad capability degrades, never crashes the run), runtime expansion. A capability
raising is caught and turned into an error fragment.

---

## Event model — one vocabulary

The engine is the single source. Events describe the **DAG lifecycle**, never a
domain — adding Browser/Email needs zero new event types. Every event carries
`type, run_id, seq` (monotonic), `ts`.

```
run.started {groups, planned_count}      plan.expanded {added_count, total_count}
task.started {task_id, capability, op, group, summary}
task.progress {task_id, message}         task.evidence {task_id, status, confidence, citations}
task.completed {task_id, duration, status}
task.retrying / task.failed              group.completed {group}
run.completed {completed, failed} / run.cancelled
# reserved (route/Reducer/Reasoner, not engine): reduce.* reason.* artifact.created
#                                                 approval.required auth.required
```

`group` + `summary` are the only layout drivers: a multi-lane `/crew` and a
single-stream `/research` are the **same event stream**, different grouping → the
front-end collapses to one `<ExecutionTimeline>` (Cursor / Deep-Research style).
During migration, thin per-route adapters translate these to the legacy SSE names
so the existing UI keeps working byte-for-byte.

---

## The Endo Kogyo walkthrough

1. **Resolve** "Endo Kogyo" → `customer_id` (existing resolver; ambiguity → picker).
2. **Seed plan** (deterministic `meeting_prep` template): parallel READ tasks —
   `CRM.list_deals/list_proposals/list_quotes`, `Activities.meeting_notes`,
   `Filesystem.find_documents`, `Calendar.find_events`, `Email.recent`,
   `Knowledge.relevant_playbooks`.
3. **Runtime expansion**: `find_documents` → N refs → `ctx.expand(Office.extract×N)`;
   `Email.recent` → threads → `Email.fetch_thread×M`. `plan.expanded` fires.
4. **Parallel gather** under per-capability concurrency caps + auth. `Email` token
   expired → `auth.required`; that branch degrades, the rest proceeds.
5. **EvidenceBundle** accumulates ~30 fragments with citations + confidence.
6. **Reducer** (30 docs overflow the reasoner) → per-document/group map summaries.
7. **Reasoner** (single) → prep summary + follow-up plan, citing sources.
8. **Approval Gate**: "draft follow-up" is WRITE → `approval.required` + preview →
   on approve, `Email.draft` / `Office.export_pptx` → `artifact.created`.

### Weaknesses this surfaces (and the answers)

| Weakness | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Context overflow on "every document" | **Reducer** map-reduce before synthesis |
| Per-user auth/secrets for external caps | `ConnectionProvider` field on `ExecContext`; `auth.required` event |
| Cost / rate limits (Browser, APIs) | per-capability concurrency caps + `priority` + timeouts + cancellation |
| Effectful safety/ordering (send, book) | `OperationKind=WRITE` + **Approval Gate**; no auto-retry/cache |
| Repeated work across sessions | content-addressed `cache` key in `TaskPolicy` |
| Open-ended intent phrasing | `Planner` seam → future `LLMPlanner`, same `ExecutionPlan` |
| Non-reproducibility of web/email/browser | provenance + timestamps make it *auditable*, not reproducible |

The first four mitigations are *seams reserved in M0* (event constants,
`ExecContext`/`TaskPolicy` shape), not yet implemented — so adding them is not a
rewrite.

---

## M0 — what shipped

`senpai/orchestration/`, GPU-free, no network, not wired to routes:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capability.py` | `Task`, `TaskPolicy`, `ExecutionPlan` (+cycle check), `Capability`, `ExecContext`, `CapabilityRegistry` |
| `evidence.py` | `Evidence` (`ok/empty/error`), `EvidenceBundle` (views, `to_reasoner_view`), `Timing` |
| `engine.py` | `ExecutionEngine` — the one scheduler loop |
| `events.py` | the unified event vocabulary (constants + shapes) |
| `reason.py` | `Reasoner` Protocol + `EchoReasoner` (no-LLM) + `LLMReasoner` (lazy) |
| `reducer.py` | `Reducer` Protocol + `PassthroughReducer` |
| `planner.py` | `Planner` Protocol seam |
| `__main__.py` | self-test |

**Self-test** (`python -m senpai.orchestration` → `RESULT: PASS`) proves: parallelism
(7 tasks 0.5s wall vs ~1.4s serial), dependency ordering, runtime fan-out, retries,
partial-failure degradation, ordered timeline, citations, error-dropping view.

### Simplifications taken (deferred, with a seam)
Planner classes, `Ref` input-binding DSL, `OperationKind` enum + Approval Gate, full
Reducer/Reasoner impls, plan-level reasoner/reducer specs, `priority`/`cache`/per-op
`defaults`, `ConnectionProvider`/`auth.required` — all dropped from M0, each kept as
a Protocol stub or a reserved field/constant so it is additive.

---

## Migration (zero-regression first)

- **M0** ✅ scaffolding, isolated, unit-tested.
- **M1** ✅ Research over the engine — parity-proven, live (details below).
- **M2** ✅ Crew + team gather over the engine — multi-agent UX preserved (below).
- **M3** ✅ Consolidation + account gather over the engine — parity-proven (below).
- **Simplification phase** (deferred, post-migration) — converge the three reasoners
  onto `reason.py`, unify the SSE dialects onto `events.py`, then (a product
  decision) collapse the multi-agent flow into one Planner → Engine → Reasoner.
  `/api/chat`'s dynamic tool-loop stays until the `LLMPlanner` seam is built.

Capabilities call `store`/`scoring` directly (structured), not the string tools in
`impl.py` — those stay for the chat loop. `llm/client.py` is untouched; the Reasoner
wraps `stream_complete`.

---

## M1 — Research migrated (parity-proven)

The Research gather now runs on the engine; resolution, source emission, ambiguity,
web-fallback, and the reasoner are unchanged. **The frontend cannot tell.**

`senpai/research/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `shaping.py` | byte-for-byte replicas of the server's `_deal_summary` (split into `deal_facts` + `health_read`), `_activity_summary`, `_public_customer`, `_products_for_deals` |
| `capabilities.py` | `CRM`, `Activities`, `SimilarDeals`, `Health`, `Environment`, `Web` — thin wrappers over `store` / `score_deal` / `find_similar_deals` / `web_search_typed` |
| `plan.py` | `research_plan(mode=customer\|deal)` + `web_plan()` |
| `gather.py` | runs the engine, re-merges facts+health, rebuilds provenance per mode → the exact legacy field set |

**The DAG (proves dependency handling):** `crm`, `activities`, `similar_deals`,
`environment` run in parallel; **`health` depends on `crm` + `similar_deals`** (it
scores every deal id they surfaced). The gather re-merges
`{**deal_facts, "health": …}` into the identical legacy `_deal_summary` shape.

**Wiring:** `_build_research_bundle` / `_build_deal_context_bundle` get `*_orch`
twins that the live `/research` (and the chat research route) call; the legacy
builders are kept as the **parity oracle**, not deleted (per "remove only after
parity is confirmed").

**Parity strategy:** the LLM answer is non-deterministic, so we don't diff text — we
prove the *evidence bundle fed to the reasoner is identical*
(`orch.to_dict() == legacy.to_dict()`), which makes artifact quality identical by
construction. `tests/test_research_parity.py` (84 cases): 40 customers × valid-
customer bundle, 40 deal-context bundles, citations present, not-found shell,
web-fallback pass-through, and **partial-failure degradation** (a capability raising
→ that source becomes empty/`not_found`, the run still completes — where the legacy
inline code would have crashed). Full suite: **219 passed, 0 regressions** (the one
remaining `test_research.py` failure is pre-existing and unrelated — verified
identical with M1 changes stashed).

**One deviation:** the not-found **web fallback stays on the direct `web_search_typed`
seam**, not routed through the engine. It is a single external call (not gather
orchestration) and existing tests patch that symbol; routing it through a 1-task plan
added no value and moved a test seam. `WebCapability` is still built and exercised by
the golden test via `web_search_via_engine`.

---

## M2 — Crew gather migrated (multi-agent UX preserved)

`/crew` (and the `/team` fan-out) keep their exact UX — Researcher + Coach run in
parallel, then the Strategist synthesizes a Strategy Brief — but each agent's data
gathering now runs on the engine. Prompts, artifacts, streaming events, and
provenance are unchanged.

**Why not the M1 capabilities directly?** The crew prompts were written against the
*string* outputs of the deterministic tools (`query_spr`, `find_similar_deals`,
`search_notes`, …); M1's capabilities emit *structured* evidence for the research
summarizer. Feeding the crew M1's structured bundle would change its grounding and
therefore its artifact. So M2 shares the **engine and the same underlying tool
layer**, via one tiny capability rather than the M1 capability classes:

`senpai/agent/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capabilities.py` | `ToolCapability` — runs any existing tool through `impl.dispatch(op, inputs)`. One wrapper over the shared tool layer; **zero retrieval logic duplicated** (no CRM/Activities/Health/Environment/SimilarDeals/Web reimplemented). |
| `plan.py` | `researcher_plan` (4 tools) / `coach_plan` (1) / `rep_analyst_plan` (2) — same tools, args, order, and human summaries as before. |
| `gather.py` | `run_agent_gather(plan, agent_id, emit)` — runs the plan, translates each `task.started` into the legacy `agent_tool` event (same name/summary/order), returns the tool strings for the agent to assemble its grounding. |

`crew.py`'s `_run_researcher` / `_run_coach` / `_run_rep_analyst` lost their inline
tool calls and now call `run_agent_gather`; everything else (the parallel `_worker`
threads, the prompts, `_run_strategist`, the `crew`/`agent`/`final`/`done` events) is
untouched. Net effect: each agent's tools now run **in parallel** instead of
sequentially (a latency win), with the grounding reassembled in the prompt's fixed
order so the artifact is identical.

**Parity** (`tests/test_crew_parity.py`, 63 cases): per-deal researcher grounding ==
legacy tool strings (30 deals), coach grounding == legacy (30), rep-analyst gather ==
legacy, partial-failure degradation (a tool raising → empty slot, gather completes),
and an **end-to-end `run_crew` event-sequence test** (LLM stubbed) asserting the full
`crew → agents+agent_tool → strategist → final → done` timeline is preserved. Full
suite: **282 passed, 0 new regressions** (same single pre-existing `test_research.py`
failure, unrelated).

After M2, every retrieval-heavy workflow (research, crew, team) shares the engine.
The remaining per-agent reasoning (Researcher/Coach/Strategist prose) is intentionally
kept — collapsing it into a single Reasoner is the post-migration simplification, not
part of M2.

---

## M3 — Consolidation + account migrated

Three steps, recommended order, parity-first:

**1. Dead code removed.** `_legacy_research_stream` (server.py) — an unused duplicate
of the live `research_stream` and the only remaining caller of the legacy
`_build_research_bundle` — deleted. The legacy bundle builders stay (now used only by
the M1 parity oracle).

**2. Shaping de-duplicated.** `_deal_summary` / `_public_customer` / `_activity_summary`
/ `_products_for_deals` existed byte-identically in both `server.py` and
`research/shaping.py`. `research/shaping.py` is now canonical; the server functions
are thin aliases that delegate to it (preserving every call site and the implicit
`_today()` default). The M1/M2 parity suites (147 cases) confirm no behavioral change.

**3. Account gather on the engine** (`senpai/account/`):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capabilities.py` | `AccountContextCapability` — wraps `build_account_context` as structured evidence (same call, same `(context_text, meta)`) |
| `plan.py` | `account_plan()` — a single gather task |
| `gather.py` | `gather_account_context()` — runs the plan on the engine; degrades to the package's own not-found shape on failure |

`account_commentary` now calls `gather_account_context` instead of
`build_account_context`. The commentary artifact is driven entirely by
`account_commentary_prompt(context_text)`, so identical `(context_text, meta)` ⇒
identical prompt ⇒ identical artifact. The route's events (`start` / `artifact_meta`
/ `context` / `strategy` / `delta` / `done`), the prompt, and the inline reasoner
stream are untouched.

The account context is one composite text+meta unit, so it is wrapped as a **single**
capability (like M1's web fallback). Decomposing it into the shared
CRM/Health/Environment capabilities — and converging the account prompt onto
structured evidence — belongs to the simplification phase, not M3.

**Parity** (`tests/test_account_parity.py`, 123 cases): 60 accounts × {ja, en} assert
`gather_account_context == build_account_context`, plus not-found parity and
degraded-failure resilience. Full suite: **405 passed, 0 new regressions** (same lone
pre-existing `test_research.py` failure).

---

## Migration complete — state of the spine

Every retrieval-heavy workflow now gathers through the engine:

| Workflow | Gather | Reasoner (still bespoke) | Events |
|---|---|---|---|
| research | engine (6 caps, DAG) | `_summarize_research_bundle` | source/answer |
| crew | engine (`ToolCapability`) | per-agent `simple_complete` + strategist | agent/agent_tool |
| team | engine (`ToolCapability`) | team-lead `simple_complete` | agent/agent_tool |
| account | engine (1 cap) | inline `stream_complete` | context/delta |
| `/api/chat` | LLM-planned tool loop (intentionally not migrated) | routed synthesis | tool/delta |

This table captured the state after M3. **M4 then put `/api/chat` on the engine**
(AdaptiveScheduler) and **M5 added the Workspace capability + runtime expansion** — see
those sections and the Roadmap for the current picture. The remaining work is the
`LLMPlanner` (next) plus the deferred simplification (converge the reasoners onto
`reason.py`, unify the SSE dialects, the multi-agent-collapse product decision).

---

## M4: Adaptive Execution (The Chat Loop Integration)

The `/api/chat` tool loop has now been integrated with the orchestration engine using a new **AdaptiveScheduler**. 

Instead of requiring the LLM to explicitly reason about parallelism (e.g. through a `parallel_map` tool), the runtime transparently identifies opportunities for parallel execution. The LLM simply emits consecutive tool calls in a single turn, and the scheduler determines execution strategy.

### 1. Capability Metadata and Policies
Every tool declares an execution `policy` (`READ` or `WRITE`) and a `namespace`:
- `READ` tools are side-effect free (e.g., `web_search`, `search_products`) and can be run concurrently.
- `WRITE` tools mutate state (e.g., `schedule_meeting`, `generate_pptx`) and must run sequentially.

### 2. The AdaptiveScheduler
When the LLM emits a set of independent tool calls:
1. The scheduler partitions the calls into batches (stages).
2. Consecutive `READ` operations are grouped into a single parallel stage.
3. `WRITE` operations act as barriers, forcing preceding stages to resolve and running sequentially themselves.
4. An `ExecutionPlan` is generated and passed to the existing `ExecutionEngine`.

This allows a prompt like *"Find the best laptops from MSI, ASUS, Lenovo, and Acer"* to execute 4 web searches simultaneously in the backend, radically reducing latency, while the LLM remains completely unaware of the orchestration mechanics.

### 3. Stability and UI
- **Context Length Safety**: When many parallel tools run, their concatenated output could overflow the context window (particularly for the fallback model). To guarantee stability, the engine actively truncates massive parallel payloads (e.g. to 1500 chars) before handing the evidence bundle back to the Reasoner.
- **Visualizing Parallelism**: In the frontend, tool events are tagged with a `batchId`. The `workspace` chat UI dynamically groups tools from the same batch and renders them using a hierarchical "ticks and squares" timeline, clearly exposing the parallel execution behavior to the user.

---

## M5 — Workspace capability (local files; runtime expansion in production)

The first capability that reaches **outside the seed database** — it finds and reads
real local documents and returns their text as structured Evidence into the same
EvidenceBundle every other capability feeds. It is also the **first production use of
the engine's runtime DAG expansion** (`ctx.expand`), which until now only the M0
self-test exercised. This is the proof that the spine scales past the seed DB.

`senpai/workspace/` (GPU-free, read-only, sandboxed):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `sandbox.py` | The single choke point. `safe_path` resolves a path (symlinks included) and rejects anything outside `config.WORKSPACE_ROOT`; `list_documents()` recursively lists allowed files; a missing root degrades to `[]`, never raises. |
| `extract.py` | Text extraction per type — PDF (`pypdf`), DOCX (`python-docx`), PPTX (`python-pptx`), XLSX (`openpyxl`), TXT/MD (plain). Char-capped, never raises: a corrupt file yields empty text + a note. |
| `capabilities.py` | `WorkspaceCapability` — `op="find"` relevance-ranks documents and **`ctx.expand`s one `extract` task per hit** (parallel); `op="extract"` reads one file to structured Evidence with a `file://<rel>` citation. |
| `plan.py` | `workspace_plan(query)` — a single `find` seed task; the DAG grows at runtime to fit what's on disk. |
| `gather.py` | Runs the plan on the engine; `workspace_evidence()` returns structured `{found, documents, citations}`; `gather_workspace_documents()` reduces to a grounded string. |

**The runtime fan-out (the whole point):**

```
workspace:find ──► ctx.expand ──► workspace:extract × N   (parallel)
```

`find` can't know how many documents exist, so the plan seeds one task and the
capability appends N `extract` tasks once it has looked at the disk — bounded by
`WORKSPACE_MAX_FILES`. `plan.expanded` fires; the extracts run in parallel; each lands
as its own fragment keyed `find:extract:<i>`.

**Surface + safety.** Exposed as the `search_workspace_documents` chat tool (junior /
research / manager subsets), `SEARCH` policy in `metadata.py`, and a `trace.record`
for the Retrieval Explorer. **Strictly read-only** — there is no write/edit/delete op
by design; sandbox escape is unit-tested. Config: `SENPAI_WORKSPACE_ROOT`,
`WORKSPACE_EXTS`, `WORKSPACE_MAX_FILES`, `WORKSPACE_MAX_CHARS`, `WORKSPACE_MAX_BYTES`.

**Tests** (`tests/test_workspace.py`, 7): sandbox rejects `../` / absolute / symlink
escapes; every declared type extracts; `find` fans out into one `extract` per document
(the DAG *grew*); citations are `file://…`; fan-out is capped; a missing workspace
degrades. Full suite: **7 new tests pass, 0 new regressions** (the two remaining
failures — `test_semantic` lexical, `test_research` ambiguity — are pre-existing and
fail in isolation, unrelated to this work).

### Reuse of the Segment-Intelligence pattern
Workspace deliberately mirrors `docs/segment-intelligence.md`'s proven shape: **the
tool returns grounded retrieval; the chat loop's existing synthesis round does the
"reduce"** (no nested LLM call in the tool). Same `trace.record` → Retrieval Explorer,
same "citations are provenance" discipline (`file://<rel>` here, `deal_id`s there).
So the two are already composable: a manager question can draw on **segment reports**
(why we lose these deals, from the seed DB) *and* **local files** (the actual proposal
we sent) in one EvidenceBundle. Fusing them into one grounded answer is exactly the
job of the `LLMPlanner` — now shipped for document generation (M6).

---

## M6 — LLMPlanner (goal → capability graph → artifact)

The planner that had been a `Planner` Protocol seam since M0 is now real, and
**deliberately minimal**: it is *not* an autonomous or recursive agent. It makes
exactly one decision — *which capabilities are needed to ground this document* — and
emits a static `ExecutionPlan`. The existing engine runs it; the capabilities do the
work; the terminal capability turns the bundle into the artifact.

```
goal ──► LLMPlanner ──► ExecutionPlan ──► ExecutionEngine ──► EvidenceBundle ──► artifact
         (selects caps)   (fixed 2-level DAG)   (reused)          (reused)         (a file)
```

`senpai/planner/` (the whole surface is small on purpose):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `selection.py` | `Selection` (the plan the planner emits) + `heuristic_selection` — the deterministic default and the always-available fallback. **IDs are resolved here from the store, never by the model** (the "never invent an ID" rule): an explicit `D###`, else a customer name → its primary open deal. A `proposal` with no resolvable deal degrades to a free `pptx`. |
| `capabilities.py` | Gather + terminal capabilities, each a **thin adapter over logic that already exists**. Gather: `conversation` / `workspace` / `crm` / `knowledge` / `web` emit uniform `{"text", "label"}` grounding. Three terminals **consume the bundle (via `ctx.deps`)**, never re-gather: `documents` authors+renders+registers a downloadable file (`author`/`proposal`/`render`/`registry`); `workspace_write` writes a markdown **note into the workspace** (sandbox-checked, confirm-gated `edit_workspace_document`); `workspace_organize` **tidies the workspace** — buckets loose files into topic folders via the sandbox's no-overwrite `move_within`, **preview-first**, moves only on an explicit apply cue. |
| `plan.py` | `document_plan(selection)` — the fixed two-level DAG: gather capabilities at level 0 (parallel, independent), one `documents` task depending on all of them. The edges *are* the ordering; the engine and capabilities stay ignorant of it. |
| `llm_planner.py` | `LLMPlanner.plan(goal)` — one `simple_complete` call picks the capability set + doc kind (strict JSON, validated); any failure falls straight back to `heuristic_selection`. The model chooses *what to gather*, never IDs, ordering, or execution. |
| `run.py` | `run_document_goal(goal, conversation=…)` — plan → execute on the shared `ExecutionEngine` → read the terminal `documents` fragment as the artifact. `python -m senpai.planner.run "D001 の提案書"` runs it (proposal path is GPU-free). |

**Capability-driven, not tool-driven.** The plan is expressed in capabilities
(Workspace, CRM, Knowledge, Web, Conversation, Documents), so the planner selects
*which sources ground the artifact* rather than scripting tool calls. The grounding
that `generate_pptx` used to gather *inside* the tool (conversation + workspace + CRM +
web) is now the **explicit gather half of the graph**, and the `documents` capability
consumes it from the bundle — the same grounding, promoted from a hidden side-effect to
first-class plan nodes.

**Why the artifact step has no Reasoner yet.** For document generation the artifact
*is* the file and the `documents` capability already emits the one-line confirmation, so
`run.py` returns the fragment directly. The `reason.py` seam is where meeting-prep /
account-intelligence will synthesize prose over the bundle — the next expansion, not
this milestone.

**Surface — integrated into normal chat.** `/api/chat` routes by intent: a
**document-generation goal** (`_is_document_goal` — a *create* verb + a *document* noun,
tight enough that "draft an email" / "make a quote" / "tell me about X" stay put; 稟議
excluded) is auto-routed through the planner via the shared `_plan_stream`, which emits
the same `plan | context | tool | document | answer` events the chat UI already renders —
so a plain *"make a proposal for Murata Printing"* prompt just works, **no `/plan`
prefix**. An attached file rides along as conversation context; a selector-picked deal is
authoritative. `POST /api/plan` remains as an explicit/programmatic surface. The ReAct
tool-loop and its `generate_*` tools are untouched — the planner is an additive front
door, not a replacement. Full walkthrough: **`docs/llm-planner.md`**.

**Tests** (`tests/test_planner.py`, 8, GPU-free): selection resolves a real deal id /
web-gates a general deck / resolves a customer name to its open deal; the plan's
`documents` task depends on every gather task and is acyclic; **end-to-end** a proposal
goal plans → runs on the engine → produces a *registered, downloadable* PPTX grounded on
conversation + CRM + workspace (the capability graph feeding the artifact, not a
re-gather); the `documents` grounding assembles deps most-specific-first; the authored
pptx path degrades cleanly with no model. Full suite: **8 new tests pass, 0 new
regressions** (the same two pre-existing isolation failures remain).

## Roadmap — what's live vs. what's ahead

| Capability / seam | State |
|---|---|
| ExecutionEngine, EvidenceBundle, events | ✅ live (M0) |
| Research / crew / team / account gather | ✅ live (M1–M3) |
| Chat loop on engine (AdaptiveScheduler) | ✅ live (M4) |
| Runtime DAG expansion (`ctx.expand`) | ✅ **live in production** (M5 Workspace) |
| Workspace: local file find + extract | ✅ live (M5), read-only |
| `LLMPlanner` — goal → capability graph → artifact | ✅ **live (M6)** — document generation; `senpai/planner/`, `POST /api/plan` |
| `LLMPlanner` — meeting-prep / account-intelligence / open-ended | ▶ **next** — same spine, add a Reasoner pass over the bundle |
| Approval Gate (`OperationKind=WRITE`) | ⏳ stub — generalizes today's `confirm=` |
| Reducer (map-reduce before synthesis) | ⏳ `PassthroughReducer` stub |
| `ConnectionProvider` / `auth.required` (Email/Calendar) | ⏳ reserved field/event |
| Converge the 4 bespoke reasoners onto `reason.py` | ⏳ deferred simplification |

**The `LLMPlanner` is now live for document generation (M6).** The next milestone
extends the *same spine* to open-ended flows like *"prepare me for tomorrow's Endo Kogyo
meeting"*: the planner already selects a capability graph and runs it on the engine — the
additions are (a) a broader plan shape (more gather capabilities, e.g. Segment
Intelligence + Activities) and (b) a real **Reasoner** pass (`reason.py`) that synthesizes
prose over the bundle instead of the trivial artifact-is-the-file step, with the
**Reducer** compacting when local files overflow the context. Citing both `deal_id`s and
`file://` sources already falls out of the EvidenceBundle. M6 is the proof that the
full hop — goal → capability selection → engine → bundle → artifact — works end to end.
