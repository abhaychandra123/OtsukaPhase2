# Senpai — Progress Report
### Internship Week 6 · Phase 2, Week 2 · June 2026
**Team:** AI Department (intern team) · **Audience:** Manager / mentors / Givery team
**Project:** Senpai — Sales Knowledge & Onboarding Copilot for Otsuka Shokai

## 0. Executive Summary

This week we transformed Senpai from a working prototype into a credible, production-shaped
system. The core engine remained deterministic and grounded — we never moved that principle —
but we expanded it across five major directions simultaneously:

1. **Performance.** A memoized index layer cut coaching API latency from ~7s to ~140ms (~54×
   faster) and the full test suite from 36s to 1.4s.
2. **Expanded intelligence surfaces.** Account Intelligence (8-dimension customer health),
   Morning Briefing (urgency-ranked action list), a full Account Expansion engine (cross-sell /
   upsell / growth opportunities), and a Strategic Tier + Regional Stance engine (deal-size and
   region drive a transparent, deterministic coaching posture).
3. **Deeper coaching.** Rep coaching profiles, fiscal-year progress tracking, coaching threads,
   a coaching explainability layer, and a growth/motivation portal — all deterministic.
4. **Document generation.** Four new tools: `generate_proposal` (4-slide PPTX from SPR data),
   `generate_ringisho` (Japanese 稟議書 DOCX), `generate_pptx` (free-prompt general PPTX),
   `generate_docx` (free-prompt general DOCX) — all grounded, two-step confirm before file creation.
5. **Retrieval evolution.** Hybrid BM25 + dense vector search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion,
   a runtime knowledge graph (744 nodes) with multi-hop queries, and a `search_notes` tool
   surfaced to the model — making the system meaning-aware without GPU at runtime.
6. **Workspace shell.** A unified conversational surface replacing the old split
   Assistant + Coach pages — slash commands, immutable artifacts, streaming senior reads,
   file attachment, and multi-sheet XLSX export.
7. **Ingestion via Paperclip.** A multimodal ingestion pipeline (audio/image/text) that writes
   structured `sales_activities` records through an editable draft UI — closing the capture loop
   so the knowledge base can grow from real field activity.

The total test suite grew to **137 tests (1 skipped)** across 17 test files. All engine APIs
remain GPU-free.

## 1. Architecture principles that held this week

Everything new was built against the same design spine established in Week 1:

| Principle | How it was upheld this week |
|---|---|
| **Deterministic first** | Every new subsystem (account health, expansion, morning briefing, coaching profile, progress, explainability, growth) computes its output in pure Python. The LLM only narrates the already-computed package. |
| **LLM as presentation layer** | `generate_proposal` / `generate_ringisho` inject numbers from the deterministic `DocumentContext`; the LLM writes only the value-proposition line and the 稟議書 prose. Numbers never come from the model. |
| **Grounded or silent** | Every new API endpoint includes a strict grounding contract ("never invent", "quote numbers exactly", "refer to signals by `[id]`"). On LLM failure, the deterministic summary is served unchanged. |
| **Single source of truth** | All new engines read through `store.py` — nothing bypasses the central data layer. |
| **Overlay persistence** | Ingested activities append to a gitignored overlay layer; the committed seed is never mutated. |
| **Knowledge / Experience / Motivation loop** | Week 1 established these as the design spine. This week's growth portal (§7), coaching progress (§6.2), and morning briefing (§5) close the loop explicitly. |

---

## 2. Performance — Store Indexing

**Problem.** Hot paths in the coaching engine (e.g. `coach.cases`, which finds similar deals
across thousands of activity comparisons) called relational accessors like
`activities_for_deal()`, `orders_for_customer()`, `quotes_for_customer()` in inner loops.
Each call linearly scanned the full table. At scale this produced O(rows × calls) work.

**Fix.** `senpai/data/store.py` — a new `_index()` function, memoized with `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)`,
builds **per-key dictionaries once** at first access and is dropped automatically on `reload()`.
Every relational accessor is now an O(1) dictionary hit.

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def _index() -> dict:
    acts_by_deal: dict[str, list[dict]] = {}
    for a in all_activities():
        acts_by_deal.setdefault(a.get("deal_id"), []).append(a)
    # … orders_by_cust, quotes_by_cust, deals_by_rep, deals_by_cust …
    return { … }

def activities_for_deal(deal_id: str) -> list[dict]:
    return _index()["acts_by_deal"].get(deal_id, [])
```

The index is **result-sorted** (activities: newest-first by `activity_date`; orders:
newest-first by `ordered_at`) so callers never need to sort their own slices.

**Measured impact:**

| Endpoint | Before | After | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/coach/review` (coaching) | 7.7 s | 181 ms | **~43×** |
| `/api/coach/rep-profiles` | 7.4 s | 137 ms | **~54×** |
| Full `pytest` suite | 36.4 s | 1.4 s | **~26×** |

## 3. Retrieval Evolution — Hybrid Semantic Search + Knowledge Graph

### 3.1 Hybrid semantic search (`senpai/retrieval/`)

The original retrieval was keyword/tag matching. This week we built a full two-signal hybrid
stack — GPU-free at runtime.

**Build step (`retrieval/build_index.py`):**
- Embeds each corpus (daily reports, playbook entries) with **fastembed** (ONNX/CPU,
  `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM`, 384-d) and **commits** the artifacts to `senpai/data/index/`.
- Runtime never needs a GPU or model download for the corpus side — only the live query
  is embedded (one short CPU call).
- Committed artifacts: `{corpus}.npy` (L2-normalized float32 matrix), `{corpus}.meta.json`
  (per-row metadata + raw text), `{corpus}.tokens.json` (precomputed BM25 tokens),
  `manifest.json` (model, dim, per-corpus count + content hash).

**Runtime search (`retrieval/semantic.py`):**
- **BM25 (lexical)** over Janome-tokenized, POS-filtered text (nouns/verbs/adjectives/
  adverbs only — particles and light verbs removed so function words don't pollute ranking).
- **Dense cosine** against committed vectors.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (`score = Σ 1/(k+rank)`) with `DENSE_WEIGHT=3` vs `BM25_WEIGHT=1`
  (embedding is the stronger paraphrase signal, BM25 still helps exact-term queries).
- **Text-space deduplication** before fusion: duplicate daily reports don't flood either
  signal's candidate pool.
- **Graceful degrade:** `dense + BM25 → BM25 only → keyword substring` — the richest
  available layer wins. `semantic.mode()` reports which layer is active.

**Surfaced to the model:**
- `search_notes` tool: semantic search over daily reports (日報), clamped to ≤6 results to
  cap synthesis input size.
- `retrieve_playbook` internally upgraded to this layer (same signature, backward-compatible).

**Stress tested** via `scripts/stress_retrieval.py`. Key lessons encoded in the design:
the word-boundary rule for ASCII keys (`\b` for `new` so it doesn't match `news`), and the
content-word tokenizer that stops BM25 from over-matching function words.

### 3.2 Knowledge graph (`senpai/graph/`)

A `networkx.MultiDiGraph` built from the store at runtime (cached; never drifts from the
seed data).

**Nodes:** `rep` · `customer` · `deal` · `product` · `industry:*` · `category:*` · `acttype:*`

**Edges:** `OWNS` · `FOR` · `CONCERNS` · `IN_CATEGORY` · `IN_INDUSTRY` · `HAD`

Deal nodes are **denormalized** with category/industry/outcome/rep/products/acttypes so
filter traversals are a fast scan rather than expensive graph walks.

**Current graph size: 744 nodes.**

**Parameterized query functions (`graph/query.py`):**
- `reps_who_win(category, industry, after_activity_type)` — "which reps win サーバー deals in
  製造業 after a site survey?" (relational question the flat retrieval layer can't answer).
- `account_graph(customer_id)` — full neighborhood of an account: deals, reps, products.
- `connections(a, b)` — shortest relational path between two entities.
- `similar_by_graph(deal_id)` — deals sharing rep/product/industry/category.

**Surfaced to the model:** `query_graph` tool (intent = `reps_who_win | account | connections | similar`).

---

## 4. Account Intelligence (`senpai/account/`)

Deal health answers "is **this opportunity** on track?" Account Intelligence answers "is
**this whole customer relationship** healthy and growing?" — a distinct, higher-level read
that a senior account manager would give.

### 4.1 Account health engine (`account/health.py`)

`account_health(customer_id)` → 0–100 score, band, 8 dimensions, human-readable reasons.

**Higher-is-better** (inverse of deal risk, so the two scores are never confused).

| Dimension | Weight | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| `activity_trend` | 15 | recent-90d vs prior-90d activity ratio |
| `inactivity` | 10 | days since last activity (decays 14→90d) |
| `pipeline_progression` | 15 | open deals advanced vs slipped by `order_rank` |
| `win_rate` | 15 | won / (won+lost) closed deals |
| `quote_engagement` | 10 | recent quotes + quote→order conversion |
| `order_recency` | 15 | recency of last order + repeat-order count |
| `dm_access` | 10 | share of open deals with a decision-maker identified |
| `growth` | 10 | recent-180d vs prior-180d order revenue |

**Bands:** ≥70 green (healthy/strategic), 45–69 yellow (watch), <45 red (at risk).
`AccountHealth.top_reasons(n)` returns the weakest dimensions for the commentary contract.

### 4.2 Relationship trajectory (`account/trajectory.py`)

`relationship_trajectory()` runs deterministic pattern matchers over account aggregates,
each emitting a `Pattern(id, label, evidence, polarity)` with a concrete evidence string.

- **Positive patterns:** `repeat_purchasing`, `activity_increasing`, `expansion_potential`
- **Risk patterns:** `activity_declining`, `spend_declining`, `multiple_stalled` (≥2 red
  open deals), `engaged_no_progress` (high contact, zero advancement/revenue),
  `loyal_dormant` (past wins but ≥60d silent)

### 4.3 Account expansion engine (`account/expansion.py`)

Three families of opportunity, all grounded in store records. The only authored content is
a static category adjacency map and a list of environment trigger phrases.

1. **Cross-sell** — gap categories *complementary* to what the account already owns
   (`_COMPLEMENTS` adjacency over the 7 catalog majors: OA機器, PC周辺機器, サーバー, etc.).
2. **Upsell** — environment upgrade triggers matched against the customer's IT environment
   record (`ADSL|更改検討|老朽` → ネットワーク機器; `Windows 10|EOL` → PC周辺機器;
   `無線LAN|Wi-Fi` → ネットワーク機器).
3. **Growth** — engaged account (≥2 open deals) with thin category coverage (≤2) →
   strategic-account flag.

Each `Opportunity(kind, target, rationale, evidence, confidence)` carries its own grounding.

### 4.4 Account summary and commentary (`account/summary.py`, `account/context.py`)

`build_account_summary(customer_id)` rolls up health, trajectory, and expansion into one
`AccountSummary` — industry/size, pipeline ¥, historical revenue, last activity, recent
quotes/orders, IT environment, a `recommended_focus` line (deterministic, no LLM required).

The commentary endpoint streams a senior account-manager's read under a four-heading
contract (Account Reality / Single Deal vs Whole Account / The Real Risk / Recommended Focus)
with strict grounding rules: ground every statement in the context, quote numbers exactly,
refer to signals by `[id]`, never invent.

### 4.5 API and frontend

| Endpoint | Output |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/account/{id}` | `AccountSummary.to_dict()` — deterministic |
| `POST /api/account/{id}/commentary` | SSE — streamed senior read |
| `GET /api/customers/resolve?q=…` | Deterministic name→id resolution |
| `POST /api/customers/smart-resolve` | Deterministic + fuzzy + LLM-ranked resolution |

**Frontend (`web/components/account/`):**
- `accounts-index.tsx` — discoverability surface: rolls open-deal pipeline up by customer
  (worst band, open count, pipeline ¥), sorted by pipeline value. No extra backend call —
  reuses the existing dashboard payload.
- `account-view.tsx` — the full Account Intelligence page: 8 health dimensions, risk/expansion
  signals, recent quotes/orders, IT environment, open-deal drawer, streamed senior read.

Both views are role-aware (`junior | manager`) and mount identical components.

### 4.6 Industry and customer-size differentiation

The synthetic data and the graph are both **industry- and size-aware** — this is the closest
the current system comes to geographic/market-segment differentiation.

**Customer size tiers (`_SIZE` in `data/gen_seed.py`):**
- Two tiers: `小規模` (small) and `中規模` (medium), weighted 3:1 toward SMB.
- Every customer record carries a `size` field exposed in `AccountSummary.size` and the
  graph node's attribute.
- Otsuka Shokai's real book is SMB-heavy, so the dataset intentionally mirrors that skew.

**Industry segmentation (`_INDUSTRY`):**

```
製造 / 小売 / 医療 / 建設 / 飲食 / 物流 / 教育 / 不動産 / 士業 / IT
```

10 industry tags, one per customer, propagated into:
- **Knowledge graph** — `industry:<name>` grouping nodes connected to each customer via
  `IN_INDUSTRY` edges; deal nodes carry the customer's `industry` attribute.
- **`reps_who_win(category, industry, after_activity_type)`** — parameterized query that
  filters the win-rate leaderboard to a specific industry, answering "which reps close
  サーバー deals in 製造業 after a site survey?"
- **`similar_by_graph(deal_id)`** — multi-signal similarity scorer that adds +1 for an
  industry match (on top of +2 per shared product, +1 for same rep), so industry context
  shapes which past deals surface as comparable.
- **`account_graph(customer_id)`** — returns `industry` and `size` in the customer header
  so the senior commentary can frame risk in market-segment terms.
- **`AccountSummary`** — `industry` and `size` are first-class fields; the account-context
  assembler includes them in the grounded header line fed to the model.

**Design note:** industry is the primary market-segment discriminator; size captures the SMB
vs mid-market split that shapes deal complexity and decision-maker topology. A **`region`**
field (関東 / 関西 / その他) was also added this week to drive the Strategic Stance engine
(§4.7).

### 4.7 Strategic Tier + Regional Stance (`account/strategy.py`)

A deterministic **pre-query stance selector**: before the model writes any account read, a
pure function picks the *coaching posture* from two hard facts — the account's largest open-deal
amount (→ a Strategic Tier) and the customer's region (→ a regional modifier). It returns both
the **directives injected into the prompt** and a transparent **rationale surfaced to the rep**,
so the salesperson always sees *which* threshold and *which* region produced the advice — and
can override it.

**Strategic Tiers** (driven by the largest open deal; the biggest opportunity sets the posture):

| Tier | Band | Stance directives |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 メガ案件 | ≥ ¥1.5M (top ~5%) | Advisory, not quick-close; 根回し (nemawashi) across stakeholders; multi-layer 稟議 (ringi) prep; involve own management |
| Tier 2 標準案件 | ¥300K–¥1.5M | Balanced consultative; needs-discovery + cost/benefit; standard approval path |
| Tier 3 ボリューム案件 | < ¥300K | High-velocity close; ROI-led pitch; minimise touch-points; shortest route to the DM |

**Threshold calibration:** the original spec proposed ¥100M / ¥5M, but Otsuka Shokai is an SMB
IT reseller — the dataset's largest deal is ¥3.12M (median ¥216K), so absolute enterprise
thresholds put **100% of accounts in Tier 3** (feature invisible). The thresholds are instead
calibrated to the data's distribution (≈p95 / ≈p60), yielding a real spread:
**6 mega / 37 standard / 107 volume** accounts (≈5% / 34% / 61% of deals). "Mega" means
"large for this book," not absolute scale — `TIER1_MIN_YEN` / `TIER3_MAX_YEN` are the single
tuning surface.

**Regional modifiers** (`region` field, derived per-customer from a local RNG keyed on
`customer_id` so SPR tables stay byte-identical):
- **関東 (Kanto)** — formal; respect process and organisational hierarchy
- **関西 (Kansai)** — direct, merchant-minded (商人気質); frank about value and price
- **その他** — neutral / standard

**Transparency (the key requirement):** the stance is *deterministic and shown*, not hidden in
the prompt. `StrategicContext` carries a bilingual `rationale` ("最大の進行中案件が¥1,800,000
（¥1,500,000以上）のためメガ案件と判定。地域: 関東。") that is surfaced on **every** account
surface, all reading the same deterministic `GET /api/account/{id}` payload (`strategy` field):

1. **Account page** (`account-view.tsx`) — a Strategic Stance card plus header chips: tier +
   region, the rationale ("why this was chosen"), and the directive bullets.
2. **Workspace `/account` brief** (`assembleAccountArtifact`) — a "Strategic stance" section in
   the immutable artifact (tier · region + rationale + directives), so the stance travels with
   the saved brief.
3. **Commentary stream** — a typed `strategy` SSE event on `/api/account/{id}/commentary` for
   any client that consumes the live stream.

The directives are injected into the commentary prompt via `StrategicContext.as_prompt_block()`;
the prompt instructs the model to *adopt the posture and reflect it in Recommended Focus*. The
directives are authored posture heuristics (like `_recommended_focus`), never factual claims —
the only data they rest on is the deal amount and region, both quoted verbatim in the rationale.

**Robustness:** `normalize_region()` keeps `AccountSummary.region` consistent with the strategy's
region for any input, and `as_prompt_block()` falls back to the neutral region directive on a
malformed region rather than raising.

Tests: `tests/test_strategy.py` (7 tests — tier boundaries, region normalization, rationale
grounding, dict round-trip, all-three-tiers-occur in the seed). Verified end-to-end through
`build_account_summary` → `build_account_context` and the stress pipeline (no SPR-data regression
from the `region` field).

## 5. Morning Briefing (`senpai/briefing.py`)

A prioritized next-best-action worklist that a rep reads at the start of their day.

**How it works:**
1. Sweeps all of a rep's open deals.
2. Scores each with the deterministic health engine.
3. Ranks by `urgency × value` where urgency is the health risk score and value is the
   deal's expected order amount.
4. Attaches **one concrete next action per deal**, derived from the dominant risk signal:

   | Signal | Action |
   |---|---|
   | `order_date_past` | 受注時期を再確認し、完了予定日を更新する |
   | `missing_dm` | 決裁者を特定する (役職者へのアプローチを設定) |
   | `staleness / low_activity` | 今日フォローの連絡を入れる (N日間接触なし) |
   | `stall_language` | 停滞の要因をヒアリングし、次の一手を決める |
   | `rank_regression` | ランク下降の原因を確認し、挽回策を立てる |

5. Adds a **predictive cadence nudge**: deals that are *about to* breach their rank's
   contact cadence — but haven't gone stale yet — surface before they turn yellow.

**Why it matters:** the briefing is as auditable as the scoring engine because every action
derives from the same `score_deal` signals and `RANK_BENCHMARKS` cadence constants. No model
invents the action. The briefing degrades to the deterministic summary if the model is offline.

**Tool wired:** `morning_briefing(rep_id, limit)` added to both junior and manager tool sets.
Tests: `tests/test_briefing.py`.

---

## 6. Expanded Coaching Platform

### 6.1 Enriched synthetic data (rep skill model)

The synthetic data generator (`data/gen_seed.py`) was upgraded with a **deterministic per-rep
skill model** (`REP_SKILL`). Each rep has characteristic weakness themes (juniors more,
experts fewer) and some juniors are flagged **improving** (their notes get more complete over
fiscal years).

- Only 3 activity fields change via a local RNG keyed on each activity (`daily_report`,
  `business_card_info`, `customer_challenge`) → SPR tables (deals/quotes/orders/amounts/dates)
  stay **byte-identical**.
- Reports now span a realistic quality spread (≈26% thorough → tapering to thin) instead of
  the old uniform 2–5 lens fill.
- **Coaching threads** (`data/seed/coaching_threads.json`): deterministic manager↔rep chat
  raised on flagged deals — `issue_key`, `status ∈ {open, acknowledged, resolved}`, dated
  `messages`. Resolved threads correlate with the improving-rep flag, giving `rep_progress`
  its acted-on signal.

### 6.2 Manager Coaching Workspace (`senpai/coaching.py`)

461-line module that answers a manager's daily question: **"where should I spend my coaching
time today?"** — four grounded views, no LLM, no new scoring.

**Seven deterministic issue rules** (`_issues()`), mapped to priority tiers:

| Issue key | Priority | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `confidence_mismatch` | high | `optimism_mismatch` flag is set on the deal |
| `missing_decision_maker` | high | deal is at `DECISION_MAKER_RANKS` but no business card title found |
| `long_inactivity` | high | last activity >30 days ago (or no activities at all) |
| `premature_discount` | medium | discount >10% AND no decision-maker OR deal in a low rank |
| `repeated_unresolved` | medium | current `order_rank` regressed vs `initial_order_rank` |
| `weak_customer_discovery` | medium | ≥3 activities but <34% have `customer_challenge` filled |
| `incomplete_reports` | low | a configurable completeness threshold |

`compute_issues()` is the public entry point — it's reused by `coach/profile.py` so the same
rules power both the workspace queue and the per-rep profile without duplication.

**Four views** (`coaching_workspace()`):

1. **`needs_coaching`** — ranked queue: primary sort by `ISSUE_PRIORITY` tier, secondary by
   deal health score descending; each entry carries one headline issue + a transparent reason.
2. **`trends`** — team-wide issue frequency, with a direction derived from `order_rank`
   movement (rank declined = "worsening", advanced = "improving").
3. **`confidence_vs_reality`** — Confidence vs Reality: the rep's stated rank (their
   expressed confidence) is cross-checked against 3 observed signals
   (quote on file, DM identified, recent activity in last 30d); mismatched deals surface first.
4. **`summary`** — a weekly digest: total open deals, deals with ≥1 issue, most-common issue.

API: `GET /api/coach/workspace`.

### 6.3 Review Coach (`senpai/coach/review.py`)

218-line module that gives a **deal-specific coaching read** by scanning what is *absent* from
a rep's note — not what is present. Absence-based firing is the key design: the lens fires
when cue phrases are **not found**, because gaps are what a senior reads for.

**Five LENSES**, each with: cue list, observation text, missing-info label, bilingual open
question, risk level, and decision factor:

| Lens | What absence signals |
|---|---|
| `decision_maker` | No 決裁・部長・社長・役員・キーマン mention — authority path unknown |
| `timeline` | No 期日・来月・Q末・スケジュール — no close horizon agreed |
| `criteria` | No 選定理由・評価・比較 — what the customer actually wants is unclear |
| `next_step` | No 次回・提案・デモ — no committed forward action |
| `budget` | No 予算・費用・価格帯 — financial qualification absent |

Also includes **presence detectors** for stall language (`検討中・返事待ち・保留`) and
competitor signals — firing even when a lens is silent.

**`CoachReview` dataclass** assembles: `observations`, `missing_info`, `risks`, `questions`,
`next_actions`, `decision_factors`, `used_deal` (the grounded deal record),
`explanations` (one per lens), and **`open_questions`** — bilingual (JA+EN) open-ended
questions that surface the unknown, never factual claims.

**Grounding P0 rule:** absence → open questions only. The coach never says "the customer
wants X" when X isn't in the note. Every question is phrased to *elicit* the missing fact,
not invent it. English equivalents live in `_LENS_QUESTION_EN` so bilingual output is
consistent.

API: `POST /api/coach/review`.

### 6.4 Similar Past Cases (`senpai/coach/cases.py`)

148-line module that teaches through **real organizational experience** rather than invented
advice. Given a rep's note (and optional current deal), it retrieves a small set of closed
deals whose situation rhymes with the current one — mixing wins and losses for contrast.

**Five situational themes**, each mapped to validated principle IDs:

| Theme | Principle IDs | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| `no_decision_maker` | P003, P006 | lost deal, no DM title in any activity |
| `discounting` | P002 | lost deal, discount >10% |
| `stalled` | P001 | lost deal, few activities or no comments |
| `budget` | P005 | cue phrases about 予算/費用 in the note |
| `discovery` | P008, P010 | note references 初回/ヒアリング/環境 |
| `disciplined_close` | P001, P010 | won deal (the positive contrast case) |

**Scoring (`find_similar_cases()`):** every closed deal starts at 0.5 (baseline so some
experience always surfaces). Product category match adds +3; thematic cue match adds +1.5;
lost deals get +0.3 (failures teach more vividly).

**Teaching mix guarantee:** the function explicitly ensures the returned set contains at least
one `won` and one `lost` deal — so the rep always sees a contrast, not just failures.

Each returned case is language-neutral facts: `deal_id`, customer name, category, amount,
outcome, theme, `principle_ids`, `decision_maker` flag, `discounted` flag, `n_activities`.
The frontend renders the localized summary; no synthetic narrative is generated here.

### 6.5 Context Retrieval Layer (`senpai/coach/context.py`)

497-line grounded context assembler. Before the model produces a commentary, this function
assembles the **full business context package** from store records so the model reasons over
real signals — not the meeting note alone.

**Resolution cascade** (`_resolve_customer_cascade()`):

| Confidence | Method | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| `high` | explicit `deal_id`, exact alias match | Ground fully — inject all customer/deal facts |
| `medium` | fuzzy character-similarity (score ≥ 0.72) | Near-miss — surface as "did you mean…?" candidate, read note-only until rep confirms |
| `low` | company-name-pattern extraction | Likely match, unconfirmed — same near-miss policy |
| `none` | no customer identified | Note-only — model must not fabricate customer facts |

This prevents the most dangerous failure mode: "Okamoto Electronics" in a note must not
silently pull in 岡本電機's deal records.

**Bilingual signal translation (`_SIGNAL_EN`):**
12 regex patterns translate the engine's Japanese flag/signal strings into English at
context-assembly time. Example: `^(\d+)日間接触なし\(目安(\d+)日超\)$` → `"{N} days without
contact (over the {M}-day benchmark)"`. This means the model has no Japanese to
copy-paste into an English commentary.

**`build_commentary_context()` assembles:**
- Customer profile (name, industry, size, IT environment)
- Deal status (rank, amount, expected date, days inactive)
- Health score, band, and signals (translated to the requested language)
- Active flags in human-readable form
- Quote on file (amount, product category, discount %, quoted date)
- Order history digest (count, total ¥, last order date)
- Customer history across other deals (won/lost/open counts)
- **Account health cross-link** — `account_health(customer_id)` included so the model
  can frame a stalled deal against a healthy overall account ("deal stuck at 3_A but
  the account is green overall — not a relationship problem")
- Similar past cases (if `COACH_USE_SIMILAR_CASES` is on)
- Relevant corpus principles (if `COACH_USE_CORPUS` is on)

**DO NOT FABRICATE guards:** the context text includes explicit instructions at each
uncertain resolution tier so the model knows exactly what it can and cannot state.
Ambiguous or low-confidence matches are clearly labelled so the model hedges rather
than presenting unverified facts as certain.

### 6.6 Rep coaching profile (`senpai/coach/profile.py`)

`rep_coaching_profile(employee_id)` aggregates deterministic coaching issues across a rep's
whole book into a 1:1 brief:

- Weaknesses ranked by **severity then frequency** (missing decision-maker outranks report hygiene)
- Each weakness carries: count + **real example deals** + a **validated principle** (`knowledge/`) +
  a **real past case** (`coach.cases`) + one **concrete action**
- **Strengths**, a headline **development focus** (with explainability card), **1:1 talking points**
- **Coaching-thread status** (how many resolved, open, acknowledged)

`team_coaching_profiles()` rolls this up across the whole team for the manager.

API: `GET /api/coach/rep-profile/{id}`, `GET /api/coach/rep-profiles`.

### 6.7 Rep progress (`senpai/coach/progress.py`)

`rep_progress(employee_id, windows=4)` replays the engine **as of each of the last fiscal years**
(scoring each deal at its last in-window activity to avoid false staleness signals) and produces:
- Per-issue **trend** over time (improving/flat/worsening)
- Overall headline: 改善傾向 / 横ばい / 悪化傾向
- **Coaching acted-on rate** from threads (was past coaching resolved?)

This closes the feedback loop: the coaching engine *rediscovers* the weaknesses seeded into
the rep skill model — a seeded decision-maker-weak rep surfaces `missing_decision_maker`, and
an improving discovery-weak rep visibly trends down.

API: `GET /api/coach/rep-progress/{id}`.

### 6.8 Coaching explainability (`senpai/coach/explainability.py`)

For every coaching recommendation (lens, signal, flag, issue), `build_explanation()` assembles
a grounded explanation in four parts:

1. **Trigger Conditions** — which rule fired and what data matched
2. **Supporting Evidence** — the actual field values behind the trigger
3. **Similar Historical Cases** — real closed deals with the same pattern
4. **Outcome Statistics** — win/loss rates computed from `store.all_deals()` only
   (returned as `None` when fewer than `MIN_SAMPLE=5` closed deals match — never interpolated)

Frontend: `web/components/coach/` explainability cards.
Tests: `tests/test_explainability.py`.

---

## 7. Growth / Motivation Portal (`senpai/growth.py`)

Closes the **Motivation** pillar of the Knowledge / Experience / Motivation loop.

A read-only analytics layer that turns a rep's real activity history into visible progress
markers — purpose is encouragement, not grading.

**Five skills, each derived from a transparent ratio over real deals:**

| Skill | Signal |
|---|---|
| `relationship_building` | Repeat-visit activity rate |
| `decision_maker_discovery` | Share of deals with business_card_info filled |
| `customer_discovery` | Share of activities with customer_challenge filled |
| `closing_discipline` | Order-rank advancement rate |
| `proposal_pricing` | Quote-to-order conversion rate |

Each daily report is treated as one completed coaching review (rep reflecting on a call) —
the closest real proxy to "reviews completed" without persisting app usage.

Frontend routes: `web/app/junior/` and `web/app/manager/` growth pages.

---

## 8. Document Generation Tools (`senpai/documents/`)

Four new tools add a **document output layer** to the assistant — one of the highest-value
actions a rep takes when a deal is near closing.

### 8.1 `generate_proposal` — 4-slide PPTX sales proposal

Grounded entirely in the deal's SPR data via `DocumentContext` (built by `documents/context.py`):

| Slide | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Title | Customer name + value proposition | LLM narration (one line only) |
| 2 — 課題 | Up to 5 pain points | `sales_activities.customer_challenge` + `daily_report` |
| 3 — ソリューション | Matched catalog products with codes + prices | `products.json` |
| 4 — 投資対効果 & 次のステップ | Deal financials (HW/SW/services splits) + comparable deals | SPR `total_order_amount`, `quotes` |

**Design principle:** all ¥ numbers come from the deterministic `DocumentContext`. The LLM
writes only the value-proposition subtitle. A footnote on each slide states its data source.

### 8.2 `generate_ringisho` — 稟議書 (DOCX)

A formal Japanese internal-approval document written from the **customer's IT-manager persona
pitching their own CEO**. Structure:

1. 背景・課題 — grounded in SPR pain points
2. 提案内容 — grounded in catalog products
3. 投資額と効果 — injected from `DocumentContext.financials` (never invented)
4. 結論・承認依頼
5. 承認欄

LLM writes the prose sections; the financial table is a deterministic injection.

### 8.3 `generate_pptx` / `generate_docx` — general-purpose document tools

Free-prompt LLM-authored documents, optionally grounded by internal records (`/api/account`)
or web search. **Two-step confirm** before any file is created (the model surfaces a slide/
section outline; the user confirms before the file is written). Both degrade cleanly when
the model is offline.

### 8.4 Download flow

All four tools save to `config.GENERATED_DIR` and return a download path. The web UI exposes
a download button. Smoke-tested with `python -m senpai.documents.proposal D001` and
`python -m senpai.documents.ringisho D001`.

Tests: `tests/test_documents.py` — the deterministic proposal/ringisho path is fully covered
(no GPU); general PPTX/DOCX tests assert clean degradation when `SENPAI_USE_LLM` is off.

---

## 9. Workspace Shell (`web/components/workspace/`)

The Workspace replaces the old split `Assistant` + `Review Coach` pages with one conversational
surface where deterministic skills, grounded artifacts, and ordinary chat coexist.

### 9.1 Three skills (slash commands)

| Command | Backend | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| `/review <note or deal id>` | `POST /api/coach/review` + SSE narrate | **review** artifact — 6 teaching sections + streamed senior read |
| `/account <name or id>` | `GET /api/account/{id}` + SSE commentary | **account_brief** artifact — health, risk signals, expansion, focus + streamed read |
| `/research <question>` | `POST /api/chat` (research role) → SSE | **research** artifact — source ledger + grounded answer + web citations |
| *(bare turn)* | `POST /api/chat` (junior/manager tool-loop) | normal chat reply with tool ledger |

The *user*, never an intent-classifier, decides which skill runs — the trust boundary stays legible.
Unknown commands are rejected, not silently reinterpreted.

### 9.2 Artifact model

An **Artifact** is the typed, immutable, grounded output of a skill:

- **Immutability:** a skill never edits an artifact in place. Re-running appends a new artifact
  that `supersedes` the previous one.
- **Deterministic provenance:** `evidence` carries source IDs only (deal/SPR/principle/
  playbook/web IDs). The LLM is never the source of an evidence entry.
- Evidence IDs are parsed with a strict regex (`/^(PB\d+|P\d+|I\d+|D\d+)$/`); a stray human
  name can never become evidence.

Three assemblers — `assembleReviewArtifact`, `assembleAccountArtifact`, `assembleResearchArtifact`
— map existing API payloads into artifacts and add no facts.

### 9.3 Unified rendering

The old three duplicated card renderers were collapsed into a single `ArtifactBody` driven
by a `KIND_META` table (per-kind header, alert, commentary placement).
Sub-components: `Markdown`, `SectionBlock`, `CommentaryBlock`, `EvidenceDrawer`.

### 9.4 File attachment to context (Part A)

The chat input now supports **file attachment**: a user can clip a file and its text content
is injected into the next turn's context — grounding the conversation in an uploaded document
without a separate ingestion round-trip. Captured via a "Capture card" that is editable before
submission.

### 9.5 Multi-sheet XLSX export

Every ready artifact carries an **Export** button that downloads a real `.xlsx` via
`write-excel-file/browser` (dynamically imported, no SSR).

**Trust model:** export is a **serializer, not a generator** — only reformats the already-grounded
artifact, adds no facts, LLM touches nothing. Two sheets:
- **Brief** — heading + meta + each section + senior read commentary
- **Sources** — evidence table (deal/SPR/principle/playbook/web IDs + URLs)

Provenance travels into the file so the workbook stays auditable after it leaves Senpai.

---

## 10. Capture via Clip + Ingestion Pipeline

Closes the capture loop: a rep uploads a voice memo or business-card photo → it becomes a
structured, editable SPR draft → confirmed records go live in the engine immediately.

This is **two separate layers** that were built and integrated this week:

### 10.1 Capture via Clip (frontend — `web/components/workspace/workspace.tsx`)

A **paperclip button** in the Workspace input bar (commit `bfdb542`). The user selects an
`audio/*` or `image/*` file; the workspace immediately posts it to `POST /api/ingest` and
renders a **`CaptureTurn`** in the thread — a card with five editable fields:

| Field | SPR column |
|---|---|
| Activity type (dropdown) | `activity_type` |
| Daily report | `daily_report` |
| Contact / business-card info | `business_card_info` |
| Customer challenge | `customer_challenge` |
| Product category | `product_major_category` |

Design decisions:
- **Deliberately mutable** — unlike the immutable skill artifacts (`/review`, `/account`),
  a capture draft is *meant* to be edited (it will become an SPR record). So it carries the
  raw `IngestResult`, not an `Artifact`.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — the draft must be reviewed before saving. Hallucinations from the
  extraction model are caught here before they touch the store.
- **Mock badge** — when the multimodal API is offline, extraction returns a mock result; a
  yellow "モック抽出" badge flags this so the rep knows it needs manual filling.
- **Copy button** — copies the whole draft as plain text so it can be pasted into an external
  SPR system if needed.
- i18n: all labels and toasts are bilingual (`capture.*` keys in `web/lib/i18n.tsx`).

### 10.2 Multimodal ingestion backend (`senpai/ingestion/pipeline.py`, `ingestion/multimodal.py`)

`MultimodalIngestor` handles three modalities:
- **Audio** (voice memos) → Whisper transcription
- **Images** (business cards, whiteboards) → Vision/OCR text extraction
- **Text** — direct pass-through

All modalities feed a structured extraction step (LLM → `ActivityExtraction` Pydantic schema)
that outputs the five SPR fields listed above. Extraction uses the local model endpoint with
an OpenAI-compatible fallback (`INGEST_BASE_URL`/`INGEST_API_KEY`); offline it returns a
deterministic skeleton so the frontend always receives a parseable draft.

### 10.3 Persistence (`ingestion/persist.py`)

`build_activity_record()` produces a record in the **exact seed shape** — correcting three
gaps in the earlier prototype:
- Fiscal year/quarter from the Japanese fiscal calendar (`config.fiscal_year_quarter`), not mocked.
- Department/division from the actual rep record, not hardcoded.
- `days_since_last_order` / `total_order_count` derived from the customer's real order history.

`store.append_activity()` writes to the gitignored overlay (`config.INGESTED_DIR`) and drops
the `_index` / `_load` caches — the next request reads the ingested activity like any
committed row. The committed seed is never mutated.

Tests: `tests/test_ingestion_persist.py`.

---

## 11. Knowledge Pipeline (`senpai/knowledge/`)

A full four-layer pipeline for turning senior interview quotes into coaching items that
juniors can trust — with computed (not authored) confidence and a mandatory human approval gate.

### 11.1 Data model (`knowledge/schema.py`)

Four layers, each a plain dataclass serialised to committed JSON (auditable in a diff, no DB):

| Layer | Object | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Source` | A raw interview or survey (`source_id`: I01, I02…) |
| 1 | `Principle` | A **validated claim** backed by ≥1 cited interview quote — the ground truth GenAI may never exceed |
| 2 | `GeneratedItem` | A **draft coaching item** (scenario + signals + questions + risks + alternatives) generated from ONE principle |
| — | `Provenance` | Model, prompt version, generated_at, `grounding_passed` flag |
| — | `Review` | Status, reviewer, reviewed_at, notes |

**Confidence is computed, never authored:**
- `CONF_HIGH` — approved + principle backed by ≥2 independent interviews
- `CONF_MEDIUM` — approved + 1 interview, or corroborated by survey
- `CONF_LOW` — approved but thinly sourced
- `CONF_UNVERIFIED` — not approved or failed grounding → **never shown to juniors**

### 11.2 Generation (`knowledge/generate.py`)

`generate_item(principle_id)` → `GeneratedItem` (status: `draft`).

The model receives **only** the validated principle + its source quotes. Hard rules enforced in
the prompt and verified by `ground_check`:
1. No new advice/numbers/proper nouns not in the principle.
2. Scenario may be fictional; signals/questions/risks must be entailed by the principle.
3. `alternatives` must include 1–2 "it depends" counter-views (no single correct answer).

`ground_check` catches cheap hallucinations before human review: rejects items that contain
invented numbers (`\d+\s*[%％]|\d[\d,]*\s*円`). Offline fallback: a deterministic skeleton
item (restates the principle) so the pipeline runs without the model server.

### 11.3 Human review gate (`knowledge/review.py`)

`approve` / `request_edit` / `reject` — the only path an item takes to becoming visible.
Every transition records who, when, and notes. `approve` forces `grounding_passed=True` if
a reviewer explicitly overrides a failed ground check (the override is logged in notes).
`pending()` surfaces draft/needs_edit items with grounding-passed items first, so reviewers
triage the clean ones fast.

### 11.4 Persistence (`knowledge/store.py`)

Two committed JSON files (`sources.json`, `principles.json`, `generated_items.json`) plus
sidecar overlay files (`*.ingested.json`) for manager-contributed knowledge — same pattern
as `senpai/data/store.py` (overlay appended, seed canonical).

Currently: **11 validated principles**, **7 approved coaching items** in the committed seed.

### 11.5 Knowledge Explorer frontend

`web/components/knowledge/knowledge-explorer.tsx` (significantly expanded this week) shows
principles with verbatim interview provenance, computed-confidence badges, and their derived
coaching items — each traceable to the exact senior quote it came from.

---

## 12. Additional Tools Added

The tool set grew from 18 to **38 functions** in `senpai/tools/impl.py`.

New tools added this week:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `find_deals` | Schema-driven faceted deal search — `product_category, industry, size, outcome, order_rank, profile_tags, min_amount, max_amount, product_code, limit` — all SPR fields, no invented filters |
| `search_notes` | Semantic search over daily reports (日報) — meaning-aware, BM25+dense |
| `query_graph` | Multi-hop knowledge graph queries (`reps_who_win`, `account`, `connections`, `similar`) |
| `search_knowledge` | Semantic search over validated knowledge principles + playbook |
| `search_products` | Faceted product catalog search (`category, max_price, product_code`) |
| `create_quote` | Draft a quote from catalog items with discount, grounded in real prices |
| `get_calendar` | Calendar lookup for scheduling context |
| `morning_briefing` | Urgency-ranked daily action list (§5) |
| `generate_proposal` | 4-slide PPTX from SPR deal data (§8.1) |
| `generate_ringisho` | 稟議書 DOCX (§8.2) |
| `generate_pptx` | Free-prompt general PPTX (§8.3) |
| `generate_docx` | Free-prompt general DOCX (§8.3) |
| `schedule_meeting` | Two-step Google Calendar booking (draft → confirm → real event) |

`schedule_meeting` received a **two-step confirm** upgrade: `confirm=False` returns a draft
for human review; `confirm=True` lazily imports `gcal` and books, with `（シミュレーション）`
fallback if the Calendar call fails.

---

## 13. Latency Investigation and Router/Model Evals

Full details in `docs/phase25_session_log.md`. Summary of decisions:

### 13.1 Latency investigation (prompt + routing, no model change)

Baseline: ~395s end-to-end on a multi-tool research turn.
- **Tool-selection round (~23s):** capping `<think>` buys ~nothing — left intact.
- **Final synthesis (~230s):** dominates. Lever is input/output *size*, not think budget.

Three changes landed:
1. Parallel tool calls: system prompts now instruct the model to emit independent lookups in
   one turn (fewer sequential selection rounds).
2. Router rule: all-retrieval multi-tool turns → FAST mode (no reasoning needed for pure
   data retrieval).
3. `search_notes` clamp: `limit` clamped to ≤6 (caps dominant synthesis input).

**Result: ~395s → ~256s.**

### 13.2 Atlas intent-router evaluation (offline, NOT shipped)

63 hand-labeled bilingual queries, `LogisticRegression` on MiniLM embeddings, 5-fold CV.

- Destination head (research/tool/chat): ~0.82 — usable but not a clear win over rules.
- Mode head (fast/think): ~tie with `DeterministicReasoningRouter` — rules already as good.
- Tool-hint head (which tool): ~0.49 — not separable in MiniLM space.

**Decision: do not build Atlas.** Rules win on simplicity and on the mode head.

### 13.3 Model decomposition (in progress)

Question: can the final synthesis step use a smaller model (Qwen3-8B) for a latency win
while the 27B keeps doing tool selection?

Round 1 (bf16-8B vs Q4_K_M-27B, 4 FAST queries):

| Arm | Avg latency | Grounding fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| 27B Q4_K_M | 64.9s | 0.957 |
| 8B bf16 | 58.5s | 0.961 |

Speedup only ~1.11× because both move similar bytes/token (bf16-8B ~16GB ≈ Q4-27B ~14GB).
**Key finding: an 8B achieves parity grounding quality.** Round 2 (Q4_K_M 8B, ~5GB → ~3×
fewer bytes/token) is pending; expected ~3× synthesis speedup.

---

## 14. SSE Event Protocol and Resolution Improvements

### 14.1 Customer resolution — word-boundary rule

Fixed a live `news → new` false match. ASCII/romaji alias keys now require regex word
boundaries (`\b`); Japanese keys keep substring matching (no word boundaries in JA text).

```python
def _key_in_text(key, low_text):
    if key.isascii():
        return re.search(r"\b" + re.escape(key) + r"\b", low_text) is not None
    return key in low_text
```

Added `C##` customer-id recognition alongside `D###` deal-ids in free-text extraction.

### 14.2 Tool-calling fix (no-think suppression bug)

**Symptom:** "setup a meeting" narrated a fake `[ツール呼び出し]` instead of calling the tool.
**Root cause:** `TOOLLOOP_NO_THINK` empty-`<think>` prefill in the **selection** round suppressed
tool emission.
**Fix:** selection rounds now use `_prep(convo, False)` (keep think) + a prompt directive
"call tools directly, don't narrate". A/B test confirmed: `NOTHINK_ON` → 0 tool calls,
`NOTHINK_OFF` → `schedule_meeting` called correctly.

### 14.3 Reasoning leak fix

`_strip_reasoning` generalized to handle `<think>`, `<thinking>`, `<analysis>`, `<reasoning>`
tag variants. Research summarizers routed through `_strip_reasoning`.

### 14.4 Health engine double-count bug fix (`9194756`)

`staleness` and `low_activity` signals were **both firing on the same silence** condition,
double-penalizing deals that had no recent activity. Fixed in `senpai/health/scoring.py` +
`flags.py` so the two signals are mutually exclusive (staleness subsumes low_activity).
`tests/test_scoring.py` gained 15 new assertions covering this exact edge case.

---

## 15. Quality Assurance Infrastructure

Beyond the pytest suite, this week added three categories of test/audit tooling:

### 15.1 Stress pipeline (`scripts/stress_pipeline.py`)

A hermetic robustness harness (no GPU, no network) that probes 7 aspects of the
deterministic core in one run:

1. **Tool dispatch** — every tool survives empty / garbage / hostile args and never raises
   (the chat loop must never crash); valid calls produce non-empty output.
2. **Scoring engine** — edge cases (empty fields, missing dates, junk values, every
   `order_rank` value); score always in 0–100 with a valid band.
3. **Flags engine** — same edge cases; never crashes.
4. **Morning briefing** — every rep + team + unknown rep; sorted, grounded, deterministic.
5. **`find_deals`** — facet filters honoured, outcome matches the rank model, hostile
   inputs never crash, deterministic.
6. **Store referential integrity** — all deals resolve to real customers/reps; unknown IDs
   degrade to `None`/`[]`.
7. **Whole-pipeline determinism** — score every open deal twice → identical results.

### 15.2 Health score backtest (`scripts/backtest_health.py`)

A calibration harness that validates the health score against actual deal outcomes:

- Scores every **closed** deal (won = `WON_RANKS`, lost = `DEAD_RANKS`).
- Computes **AUC** — P(a lost deal scores riskier than a won deal); 0.5 = no signal, 1.0 = perfect.
- Produces a **calibration table**: for each band (and raw-score bucket), the actual loss rate.

On the synthetic seed this validates internal consistency (does the score separate the
outcome labels the generator baked in?). The same script is ready for real historical data —
the report layout is identical, making it the calibration tool for when SPR access arrives.

### 15.3 Grounding audit scripts

Three grounding audit scripts (`scripts/grounding_audit.py`, `grounding_audit4.py`,
`grounding_reaudit.py`) that run on the deterministic engine (no LLM) and check:

- **Cross-customer leakage** — does retrieval ever surface records from a different customer
  than the one in focus?
- **Prompt composition by source** — classifies every line of the commentary context into
  `customer_core / crm / deterministic_health / activity / quote_order / environment /
  similar_case_CROSS_CUSTOMER / corpus_playbook`, then reports the fraction of each type
  so we can audit how grounded each prompt is.
- **Structural origin classification** — distinguishes customer evidence (safe) from
  cross-customer analogies (labelled) from corpus/playbook content.

### 15.4 Contract checker (`scripts/check_contract.py`)

Hits every GET endpoint the web client calls via FastAPI's in-process `TestClient` and asserts
that the top-level keys the TypeScript types expect still exist. Runs in <1s with no GPU.

**Discipline enforced:** `docs/web-integration.md` documents the one-boundary rule:
"endpoint first, then `types.ts` → `api.ts` → `fixtures.ts` → component" — so the Python
engine and the Next.js app can never silently drift. `scripts/check_contract.py` is the
automated enforcement gate.

### 15.5 Live cache test (`scripts/live_cache_test.py`)

End-to-end test that drives the real bridge in-process via `TestClient`, parses the actual
SSE stream, and verifies that `context`/`cached` flags are set correctly and real tokens
stream from the LLM. Requires the model server on `:8765` (`SENPAI_USE_LLM=1`).

---

**New tests this week:** +18 coaching tests, +10 document tests, +8 graph/semantic tests, +6
briefing tests, +7 strategy tests = **+49 new tests** since the start of Week 2.

---

## 17. Retrieval Observability — Retrieval Explorer

**`senpai/retrieval/trace.py`** is a per-turn observability buffer using Python's `ContextVar`
so concurrent requests never share state. Every retrieval surface (`notes_semantic`,
`knowledge_keyword`, `graph`) records into this buffer: source type, source ID, customer,
score, scope (`account:<id>` or `all`).

The API drains the buffer after each tool call and ships it to the UI as `tool` events in the
SSE stream.

**`web/components/assistant/retrieval-explorer.tsx`** is the UI surface — a collapsible
panel in the chat thread that shows for every turn:
- Which retrievers fired (`日報（意味検索）`, `社内ナレッジ（キーワード）`, `関係グラフ`)
- Scope: **account-scoped** (green badge, the trustworthy default) vs **all customers**
- Per-chunk detail: ID, customer name, score

This makes grounding **debuggable** — you can see exactly which chunks reached the model
and immediately spot cross-customer leakage.

---

## 18. Synthetic Dataset Expansion

The seed dataset was massively expanded to **FY2023–FY2026 historical data** (3 cohorts):
- **Live pipeline** (~140 deals): `order_rank` 2_A+…6_P, dated within 0–90 days of anchor
- **Historical won** (~280 deals): `1_Confirmed`, spread across prior fiscal years
- **Historical dead** (~100 deals): `7_Lost`/`8_Cancelled`

`store.open_deals()` filters to open ranks so the live dashboard stays bounded at ~140
even though the corpus is 520.

| File | Rows | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| `deals.json` | **520** | Opportunity-level records |
| `sales_activities.json` | **2,337** | Activity log / daily reports |
| `quotes.json` | **480** | Quotes for progressed deals |
| `orders.json` | **280** | Order lines (confirmed/won deals) |
| `customers.json` | **150** | SMB customer master (industry, size, and new `region` field) |
| `reps.json` | **24** | Sales reps (junior + senior, skill profiles) |
| `products.json` | 29 | Product master (major/mid/minor, pricing) |
| `environments.json` | 150 | Customer IT environment records |
| `playbook.json` | 31 | Coaching entries |
| `rank_history.json` | **1,612** | Order-rank change log (slip/regression detection) |
| `customer_aliases.json` | 150 | English/romaji alias forms |
| `coaching_threads.json` | 43 threads | Manager↔rep chat on flagged deals |

Documented in `docs/synthetic_dataset.md` (new file this week).
